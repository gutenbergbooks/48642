<span class="smaller">MUDDOCK AND MEAD</span></h2>


<p>The social birth of a family, united by a chain of
parallel events with the commercial development
of a business, is a spectacle strange to no country but
most common among the nation of shopkeepers; it
presents, however, interesting points and is likely to
produce a group of persons rather diverse in character.
Some of the family breathe the new air readily enough;
with some the straw of the omnibus (there was straw
in omnibuses during the formative period) follows on
silken skirts into the landau. It takes, they say, three
generations to make a gentleman; the schools ticket
them&mdash;National or Board, Commercial or Grammar,
Eton or Harrow. Three generations, not perhaps of
human flesh, but of mercantile growth, it takes to make
a great Concern. The humble parent-tree in the Commercial
Road puts forth branches in Brixton, Camberwell,
Stoke Newington, wherever buyers are many and
"turnover" quick: here is the second period, when the
business is already large and lucrative, but not yet imposing.
Then a new ambition stirs and works in the
creator's mind; there is still a world to conquer.
Appearance is added to reality, show to substance.
A splendid block rises somewhere within the ken of
fashion; it is red, with white facings, a tower or two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
perhaps a clock. First and last, a good deal is said
about it in talk and in print. Possibly a luncheon is
given. Now there are points of policy to be practised,
not directly productive of hard money, but powerful
in the long run. For example, the young ladies
and gentlemen who serve the counters should be well
treated, and carefully looked after in regard to their
morals. And if this be done, there is no reason against
having the fact stated with the utmost available publicity.
For this service, sections of an all-embracing Press
are ready and willing. In the eye of the polite world
this big block is now the business: the branches are
still profitable, but the ledgers alone sing their virtues;
men cease to judge the position or the purse of the
family by their humble fronts. For the family too
has been on the move; it has passed, in orderly progression,
in an ascent of gentility, from Putney to
Maida Vale, from Maida Vale to Paddington, from
Paddington to Kensington Palace Gardens. At each
stopping-place it may acquire members, at some it will
lose them; the graves where those lie who have dropped
from the ranks are themselves milestones on the march.
The survivors have each some scent, some trace, of their
place of origin. To the architect of fortune the Commercial
Road is native and familiar; he lost his first
love there and buried her down East. His second wife
dates from the latter end of the Maida Vale time and is
in all essentials of the Middle, or Paddington, Period.
The children recollect Paddington as childhood's home,
have extorted information about Maida Vale, talk of
Putney with a laugh, and seem almost of true Kensington
Palace Gardens' blood. Yet even in them there is an
element which they are hardly conscious of, an element
not to be refined away till the third generation of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
flesh has run. Then comes the perfect product; a
baronetcy is often supposed to mark, but sometimes may
be considered to precede, its appearance. Indeed&mdash;for
it is time to descend to the particular&mdash;Sir James
Muddock was hardly the perfect product; nay, he still
strove valiantly to plume himself on not being such. But
with a wife and children it is hard to go on exulting in a
lowly origin. It is also rather selfish, and was certainly
so in Sir James' case, since Lady Muddock was very
sensitive on the subject. It would seem that being of the
Middle Period is apt to produce a sensitiveness of this
sort; the pride of achievement is not there, the pride of
position is still new and uneasy.</p>

<p>Somewhat in this vein, but with a more malicious
and humorous turn of speech, Ashley Mead ran through
the history of the firm of Muddock and Mead for Lady
Kilnorton's pleasure and information. She was interested
in them as phenomena and as neighbours; they
were hardly more than across the road from her house
in Queen's Gate. Ashley spoke with full knowledge;
both business and family were familiar to him; he himself
represented an episode in the career of the concern
which survived only in its name. He used to say that
he had just missed being a fit figure for romance; his
father had not been a scatter-brained genius bought
out of a splendid certainty of wealth for fifty pounds,
but a lazy man who very contentedly and with open
eyes accepted fifteen thousand pounds and leisure in
preference to hard work and an off-chance of riches.
This elder Mead had come into the business with three
thousand pounds when capital was wanted for the Stoke
Newington branch, and had gone out when ambition
began to whisper the name of Buckingham Palace Road.
He had not felt aggrieved at losing opulence, but had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
lived on his spoil&mdash;after all, a good return for his investment&mdash;and
died with it in cheerfulness. But then
he had not been born a trader. He came of the professions;
money-making was not in his blood nor bone
of his bone, as it must be in the frame of one who is to
grow gradually by his own labour to the status of a
millionaire. The instinct of gain was not in his son
either; Ashley laughed with unreserved good-nature
as he said:</p>

<p>"If my father hadn't gone out, I should have had
half the business, I suppose, instead of starving along
on four hundred a year."</p>

<p>"You've your profession," observed Lady Kilnorton,
hardly seriously. "The Bar, you know."</p>

<p>"My profession?" he laughed, as he leant against the
mantel-piece and looked down at her. "I'm one of
five thousand names on five hundred doors, if that's a
profession!"</p>

<p>"You might make it one," she suggested, but not as
though the subject interested her or were likely to interest
him. The little rebuke had all the perfunctoriness
of duty and convention.</p>

<p>"The funny thing is," he went on, "that old Sir
James would like to get me back now; he's always
hinting about it. Shall I go and sell the ribbons?"</p>

<p>"Why can't Mr. Robert sell the ribbons?"</p>

<p>"Well, in the family we don't think Bob very bright,
you see."</p>

<p>"Oh! Alice is bright, though; at least she's very
clear-headed."</p>

<p>"More brains than any of them. And what did you
think of My lady?"</p>

<p>"Of My lady?" Irene Kilnorton laughed a little,
raised her brows a little, and paused before she said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
"Well, her hair's too fluffy, isn't it? They don't beat
her, do they? She looks rather like it."</p>

<p>"No, they don't beat her; but she's not quite sure
that she's got the grand manner."</p>

<p>"Isn't she?" said Lady Kilnorton, laughing again.</p>

<p>"And then Sir James insists on referring to Putney,
especially by way of acknowledging the goodness of
God in family prayers. The servants are there, of
course, and&mdash;you understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, Mr. Mead. In such a case I shouldn't
like it myself."</p>

<p>"Lady Muddock has no objection to being thankful
privately, but she doesn't like it talked about."</p>

<p>"You go there a great deal?" she asked, with a
glance at him.</p>

<p>"Yes, a good deal."</p>

<p>"And the girl&mdash;Alice&mdash;is very fond of you?"</p>

<p>"Not the least, I believe."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're bound to say that! Would she go with&mdash;with
selling the ribbons?" But she went on without
waiting for an answer, perhaps because she had risked a
snub. "I was received with immense <i>empressement</i>."</p>

<p>"You're a bit of a swell, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"A poverty-stricken Irish widow! No, but I took
some swells with me."</p>

<p>"Lord Bowdon, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lord Bowdon. And a greater swell still&mdash;Miss
Ora Pinsent."</p>

<p>A pause followed. Ashley looked over his hostess'
head out of the window. Then Lady Kilnorton added,
"Lord Bowdon drove Miss Pinsent to her house
afterwards."</p>

<p>Another pause followed; each was wondering what the
other's point of view might be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>"Fancy Ora Pinsent at the Muddocks'!" reflected
Ashley presently. "She went to please you?"</p>

<p>"How do I know why she went? I don't suppose
she knew herself."</p>

<p>"You're great friends, though?"</p>

<p>"I admire and despise, love and most bitterly hate,
Ora Pinsent," said Lady Kilnorton.</p>

<p>"All at once?" asked Ashley with a smile, and brows
raised in protest.</p>

<p>"Yes, all at once, and successively, and alternately,
and in all sorts of various combinations."</p>

<p>"And Lord Bowdon drove her home?" His tone
begged for a comment from his companion.</p>

<p>"I told you so," she answered with a touch of irritation,
which was as significant as any comment.</p>

<p>The servant came in, bringing tea; they were silent
while the preparations were made. Ashley, however,
covertly regarded his friend's trim figure and pretty,
small features. He often felt rather surprised that he
had no inclination to fall in love with, or even to make
love to, Irene Kilnorton. Many men had such an inclination,
he knew; among them he ranked this same
Lord Bowdon who had driven Miss Pinsent to her house.
Lady Kilnorton was young, she was pretty, she had, if
not wit, at least the readiness of reply which is the common
substitute provided by the habit of conversing with
wideawake people. It was, though, very pleasant to
have so charming a friend and to be in no danger of
transforming her into the doubtful and dangerous character
of a woman he loved; so he told himself, having
no disposition to love her.</p>

<p>"She's got a husband, hasn't she?" he asked, as the
door closed behind the footman.</p>

<p>"Ora? Oh, yes, somewhere. He's a scamp, I think.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
He's called&mdash;oh, I forget! But his name doesn't
matter."</p>

<p>"They've always got a husband, he's always a scamp,
and his name never matters," remarked Ashley between
mouthfuls of toast.</p>

<p>"Fenning! That's it! Fenning."</p>

<p>"Just as you like, Lady Kilnorton. It's the fact,
not what you call it, that's the thing, you know."</p>

<p>As he spoke the door was opened again and Lord
Bowdon was announced. He came in almost eagerly,
like a man who has something to say, shook hands
hastily, and, the instant that he dropped into a chair,
exclaimed, "What a glorious creature!"</p>

<p>"I knew exactly what you were going to say before
you opened your lips," remarked Lady Kilnorton.
"You haven't been long, though." There was a touch
of malice in her tone.</p>

<p>"It wasn't left to me to fix the length of the interview.
And she said she liked driving fast. Well, Ashley,
my boy, how are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm all right, Lord Bowdon."</p>

<p>"I've got a job for you. I'll write to you about it
presently. It's a Commission they've put me on, and
I thought you might like to be secretary."</p>

<p>"Anything with a stipend," agreed Ashley cheerfully.</p>

<p>"What a lot men think of money!" said Lady
Kilnorton.</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever met a more fascinating creature,"
Lord Bowdon mused.</p>

<p>"It's awfully good of you," continued Ashley. "I'm
uncommonly hard-up just now."</p>

<p>"Do you know her?" asked Bowdon.</p>

<p>"Met her once or twice," Ashley answered very carelessly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
Bowdon seemed to fall into a reverie, as he gently
stirred his tea round and round. Lady Kilnorton leant
back and looked at the mantel-piece. But presently he
glanced at her, smiled pleasantly, and began to discuss
the Muddocks. Ashley left them thus engaged when
he took his leave ten minutes later.</p>

<p>Lord Bowdon had lived a full and active life which
now stretched over forty-three years. In spite of much
sport and amusement he had found time for some
soldiering, for the duties of his station, and for proving
himself an unexpectedly useful and sensible Member of
Parliament. But he had not found time to be married;
that event he used to think of in his earlier days as
somehow connected with his father's death; when he
became Earl of Daresbury, he would marry. However,
about a year back, he had made Lady Kilnorton's acquaintance,
had liked her, and had begun to draw lazy
and leisurely plans about her. He had not fallen in love
with her, any more than Ashley Mead had, but he had
drifted into a considerable affection for her. His father
had lived to be old; he himself had already grown more
middle-aged than was desirable in a bridegroom. During
the last few weeks he had considered the project
seriously; and that he had assumed this attitude of mind
could hardly have escaped the lady's notice. He had
detected, with some pleasure, her hidden consciousness
of his purpose and commended her for a gracefully easy
treatment of the position. She did not make at him,
nor yet run away from him, she neither hurried nor
repulsed him. Thus by degrees the thing had become
very pleasant and satisfactory in imagination. It was
not quite what in by-gone years he had meant by being
in love&mdash;he thanked heaven for that, after reflection&mdash;but
it was pleasant and satisfactory. "Let it go on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
the end," he would have said, with a contentment hardly
conscious of an element of resignation.</p>

<p>To-day there was a check, a set-back in his thoughts,
and he was uncomfortable lest it might shew in his
manner. He talked too long about the Muddocks, then
too long about Ashley Mead, then about something
quite uninteresting. There was an unexplained check;
it vexed and puzzled him. Lady Kilnorton, with her
usual directness, told him what it was before they parted.</p>

<p>"You've been thinking about Ora Pinsent all the
time," she said. "It would have been better to have
the courage of your ingratitude and go on talking about
her." The gay, good-humoured words were accompanied
by a rather nervous little smile.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked Bowdon bluntly and with undisguised
curiosity.</p>

<p>"She's Mrs. Jack Fenning. I don't know and I don't
care who Jack Fenning is, only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only what?"</p>

<p>"Only he's not dead. I know you think that's the
one thing he ought to be."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure about that," he answered, looking in
her face. The face had suddenly become charming to
him in its now apparent mixture of annoyance and merriment.
"Well, I must be going," he added with a sigh.
Then he laughed; Lady Kilnorton, after an instant's
hesitation, joined in his laugh.</p>

<p>"She liked me to drive as fast as I could, and straight
home!" said he. "Good-bye, Lady Kilnorton."</p>

<p>"Good-bye. I wonder you aren't a little more
sensible at your age."</p>

<p>"She carries you off your feet, somehow," he murmured
apologetically, as he made for the door. He
was feeling both rude and foolish, confessing thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
the special relation towards his hostess which he had
come to occupy.</p>

<p>Left alone, Irene Kilnorton sat down and attempted
a dispassionate appraisement of herself. She was twenty-nine,
a widow of four years' standing. The world, which
had seemed ended when her young husband died, had
revived for her; such is the world's persistent way. She
was pretty, not beautiful, bright, not brilliant, pleasant,
but hardly fascinating. She was pleased with the impartiality
which conducted her so far. But at this point
the judgment of herself began to drift into a judgment
of Ora Pinsent, who seemed to be all that she herself
had just missed being; in assessing Ora the negatives
fell out and the limitations had to be discarded. Yet
her mood was not one of envy for Ora Pinsent. She
would not be Ora Pinsent. Among those various feelings
which she had for Ora, there was one which she had
described by saying "I despise her." The mood, in
truth, hung doubtful between pity and contempt; but
it was enough to save her from wishing to be Ora Pinsent.
She would sooner put up with the negatives and
the limitations. But she might wish, and did wish, that
other people could take her own discerning view of her
friend. She did not call herself a jealous woman; but
after all Lord Bowdon had become in a rather special
sense her property; now he was, as he put it graphically
enough, carried off his feet. That condition would not
last; he would find his feet and his feet would find the
ground again soon. Meanwhile, however, she could
hardly be expected exactly to like it. Men did such
strange things&mdash;or so she had been told&mdash;just in
those brief spaces of time when the feet were off the
ground; perhaps women too did things rather strange in
a similar case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>"And poor Ora's feet," she said to herself, "are never
really on the ground."</p>

<p>She was vaguely conscious that her mingled admiration
and contempt reflected in a rather commonplace
fashion the habitual attitude of good-sense towards
genius. Not being in love with commonplace good-sense
as an intellectual ideal, she grew impatient with
her thoughts, flung the window open, and sought distraction
in the sight of the people who passed up and
down the hill through the cool kindliness of the June
evening. The wayfarers caught her idle interest, and
she had almost lost herself in wondering whether the
boy and girl at the corner would kiss before they parted
when she was recalled to her own sphere by seeing two
people whom she knew breasting the slope on bicycles.
A dark young man inclining to stoutness, very elaborately
arrayed for the exercise on which he was engaged,
rode side by side with a dark young woman inclining to
leanness, plainly clad, with a face that a man might learn
to think attractive by much looking, but would not give
a second thought to in a London drawing-room. "The
young Muddocks," said Irene, drawing back and peering
at them from behind her curtains. "Recovering themselves
after the party, I suppose."</p>

<p>She watched them till they were out of sight; why, she
did not ask herself. Of course there was the interest of
wealth, perhaps a vulgar, but seemingly an unavoidable,
sensation which pounds much multiplied enable their possessors
to create. There was more; the Muddocks had
come somehow into her orbit. They were in the orbit
of her friend Ashley Mead; the girl might become the
most important satellite there. Irene's own act had
perhaps brought them into Ora Pinsent's orbit&mdash;where
storms were apt to rage. Curiosity mingled with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
absurd sense of responsibility in her. "It's such a risk
introducing Ora to anybody," she murmured, and with
this her thoughts flew back to Bowdon and the condition
of men who are carried off their feet.</p>

<p>"It's simply that I'm jealous," she declared petulantly,
as she shut the window. But she was not yet to escape
from Ora Pinsent. There on the mantel-piece was a full-length
photograph, representing Ora in her latest part
and signed with her autograph, a big O followed by a
short sprawl of letters, and a big P followed by a longer
sprawl. Though not a professed believer in the revelation
of character by handwriting, Irene found something
significant in this signature, in the impulse which seemed
to die away to a fatigued perfunctory ending, in the bold
beginning that lagged on to a conclusion already wearisome.
Her eyes rose to the face of the portrait. It
shewed a woman in a mood of audacity, still merry and
triumphant, but distantly apprehensive of some new
and yet unrealised danger. Exultation, barely yet most
surely touched with fear, filled the eyes and shaped the
smile. It seemed to Irene Kilnorton that, if Ora knew
herself and her own temper, such reasonably might be
her disposition towards the world and her own life as
well as her pose in the play to which she now drew
all the town; for her power of enjoying greatly in all
likelihood carried with it its old companion, the power
greatly to suffer. Yet to Irene a sort of triviality affected
both capacities, as though neither could be exactly
taken seriously, as though the enjoyment would always
be childish, the suffering none too genuine. Good-sense
judged genius again; and again the possessor
of good-sense turned impatiently away, not knowing
whether her contempt should be for herself or for her
friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>Then she began to laugh, suddenly but heartily, at
the recollection of Lady Muddock. When Ora had
passed on after the introduction, and Irene was lingering
in talk with her hostess, Lady Muddock had raised her
timid pale-blue eyes, nervously fingered that growth
of hair which was too fluffy for her years, and asked
whether Miss Pinsent were "nice." This adjective,
maid-of-all-work on women's lips, had come with such
ludicrous inadequacy and pitiful inappropriateness that
even at the moment Irene had smiled. Now she
laughed. Yet she was aware that Lady Muddock had
no more than this one epithet with which to achieve a
classification of humanity. You were nice or you were
not nice; it was simple dichotomy; there was the beginning,
there the end of the matter. So viewed, the
question lost its artlessness and became a singularly
difficult and searching interrogation. For if the little
adjective were given its rich fulness of meaning, its
widely representative character (it had to sum up half a
world!), if it were asked whether, on the whole, Ora
Pinsent were likely to be a good element in the world,
or (if it might be so put) a profitable speculation on
the part of Nature, Irene Kilnorton would have been
quite at a loss to answer. In fact&mdash;she asked, with a
laugh still but now a puzzled laugh&mdash;was she nice or
wasn't she? The mixture of feelings which she had
described to Ashley Mead forbade any clear and definite
response on her own behalf. On Lady Muddock's,
however, she owned that the verdict must be in the
negative. By the Muddock standards, nice Ora was
not.</p>

<p>And what was this absent Jack Fenning like? There
seemed no materials for a judgment, except that he
had married Ora Pinsent and was no longer with Ora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
Pinsent. Here was a combination of facts about him
remarkable enough to invest him with a certain interest.
The rest was blank ignorance.</p>

<p>"And," said Irene with another slight laugh, "I
suppose I'm the only person who ever took the trouble
to think about him. I'm sure Ora never does!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a><span>CHAPTER II</span>
<span class="smaller">FIRST IMPRESSIONS</span></h2>

<p>It was an indication of the changed character of
the business that the big block in Buckingham
Palace Road closed early on Saturdays, surrendering
the hours in which the branches continued to do their
most roaring trade. The day after the party was a
Saturday; Sir James and his son were making their way
back through the Park, timed to arrive at home for a
two o'clock luncheon. The custom was that Lady
Muddock and Alice should meet them at or about
the entrance of Kensington Gardens, and the four walk
together to the house. There existed in the family
close union, modified by special adorations. Sir James
walked with his daughter, Bob with his stepmother;
this order never varied, being the natural outcome of
the old man's clinging to Alice, and of Lady Muddock's
pathetic fidelity to Bob. She had no child of
her own; she looked up to Alice, but was conscious of
an almost cruel clear-sightedness in her which made
demonstrations of affection seem like the proffer of
excuses. There are people so sensible that one caresses
them with an apology. Bob, on the other
hand, was easy to please; you had to look after his
tastes, admire his wardrobe, and not bother about the
business out of hours; he asked no more, his stepmother
did no less. Thus while they crossed the Gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
Lady Muddock talked of yesterday's party, while
Sir James consulted his daughter as to the affairs of
the firm. Alice detected here and there in what he
said an undercurrent of discontent with Bob, on the
score of a lack not of diligence but of power, not of
the willingness to buckle to, but of that instinct for
the true game&mdash;the right move, the best purchase, the
moment to stand for your price, the moment to throw
all on the market&mdash;whence spring riches. Sir James
expressed his meaning clumsily, but he ended clearly
enough by wishing that there were another head in the
business; for he grew old, and, although he was now
relieved from Parliament, found the work heavy on him.
Nothing of all this was new to the listener; the tale was
an old one and led always to the same climax, the desire
to get Ashley Mead back into the business. If
Alice objected that he was ignorant and untrained in
commercial pursuits, Sir James pushed the difficulty
aside. "He's got the stuff in him," he would persist,
and then look at his daughter in a questioning way.
With this look also she was familiar; the question which
the glance put was whether she would be willing to do
what Lady Kilnorton called "going with selling the
ribbons."</p>

<p>Such was the suggestion; Alice's mood (she treated
herself with the candour which she bestowed on others)
towards it was that she would be willing to go&mdash;to go
to Ashley Mead, but not to go with selling the ribbons.
The point was not one of pride; it was partly that she
seemed to herself to be weary of the ribbons, not
ashamed (she was free from that little weakness, which
beset Bob and made him sensitive to jokes about his
waistcoats being acquired at cost price), but secretly and
rather urgently desirous of a new setting and background<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
for her life, and of an escape from surroundings
grown too habitual. But it was more perhaps that she
did not wish Ashley to sell ribbons or to make money.
She was touched with a culture of which Sir James did
not dream; the culture was in danger of producing fastidiousness.
Ashley was precious in her life because he
did not sell ribbons, because he thought nothing or too
little of money, because he was poor. The children of
the amassers are often squanderers. Alice was no
squanderer, but she felt that enough money had been
made, enough ribbons sold. With a new aim and a new
outlook life would turn sweet again. And she hated
the thought that to Ashley she meant ribbons. She did
not fear that he would make love to her merely for her
money's sake; but the money would chink in her pocket
and the ribbons festoon about her gown; if she went to
him, she would like to leave all that behind and start a
new existence. Yet the instinct in her made the business
sacred; a reverence of habit hung about it, causing
these dreams to seem unholy rebels which must not
shew their heads, and certainly could not be mentioned
in answer to her father's look. Moreover she wished
Ashley to shew himself a man who, if he took to ribbon-selling,
would sell ribbons well; the qualities remained
great in her eyes though the pursuit had lost its charms.</p>

<p>At lunch they talked of their guests. Lady Kilnorton
had pleased them all; Lord Bowdon's presence was flattering
to Lady Muddock and seemed very friendly to
her husband. Minna Soames, who had come to sing to
the party, was declared charming: hard if she had not
been, since she spent her life trying after that verdict!
Lady Muddock added that she was very nice, and sang
only at concerts because of the atmosphere of the stage.
Ora Pinsent excited more discussion and difference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
opinion, but here also there was a solid foundation of
agreement. They had all felt the gulf between them
and her; she might not be bad&mdash;Bob pretended that
he would have heard all about any scandal had there been
one&mdash;but she was hopelessly alien from them. They
were not sorry that Lady Kilnorton had brought her,
for she had added to the <i>éclat</i>, but they could not feel
sure (nor perhaps eager to be sure) that they had secured
a permanent acquaintance, much less a possible friend.
And then she had told her hostess, quite casually, that
Lord Bowdon (whom she had never met before) was
going to drive her home. Lord Bowdon was not an
old man, Miss Pinsent was quite a young woman; he
was a lord and she was an actress; of suspected classes,
both of them. Every tenet and preconception of the
Middle Period combined to raise grave apprehension in
Lady Muddock's mind. Sir James nodded assent over
his rice pudding. The son and daughter shared the
feeling, but with self-questioning; was it not narrow,
asked Alice, was it not unbecoming to a man of the
world, asked Bob. But there it was&mdash;in brother and
sister both.</p>

<p>"Ashley knows her, I think," Alice remarked.</p>

<p>"That doesn't prove anything," said Bob with a
laugh. Lady Muddock looked a little frightened. "I
mean, Ashley knows everybody," he added rather
enviously.</p>

<p>"Ashley can take care of himself," the old man
decided, as he pushed his plate away.</p>

<p>"Anyhow I don't suppose we shall see much of her,"
said Alice. Her tone had some regret in it; Ora Pinsent
was at least far removed from the making of money
and the selling of ribbons; she was of another world.</p>

<p>With this the subject passed; nobody made mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
of Mr. Jack Fenning because nobody (not even well-informed
Bob) had heard of him, and gloves had hidden
the unobtrusive wedding ring on Miss Pinsent's finger.
Indeed at all times it lay in the shadow of a very fine
sapphire; the fanciful might be pardoned for finding an
allegory here.</p>

<p>The still recent fatigues of entertaining made Lady
Muddock disinclined to drive, and Alice went alone to
the Park in the afternoon. The place was very full, and
motion slow and interrupted. Getting fast-set in a
block, she leant back resignedly, wondering why in the
world she had chosen this mode of spending a summer
afternoon. Suddenly she heard her name called and,
turning round, found a small and unpretentious victoria
wedged close to the carriage. A lady sat in the victoria;
Alice was conscious of little more than a large
hat, eyes, and a smile; when she thought of the meeting
later on, she was surprised to find herself ignorant
of what Ora Pinsent was wearing. But the smile she
remembered; it was so cordial and radiant, a smile quite
without reserve, seeming to express what was, for the
instant at least, the whole and unclouded happiness of a
human being. Thus to smile is in itself a talent.</p>

<p>"Miss Pinsent!" she exclaimed in a flutter for which
she had not time to rebuke herself.</p>

<p>"I wasn't quite sure it was you," Ora explained.
"But I thought I'd risk it. Isn't it dull?" Her eloquent
hands accused the whole surroundings.</p>

<p>"This block's so tiresome," observed Alice; she felt
the obviousness of the remark.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind whether we move or not. I mean
driving alone. But perhaps you do it from choice. I
don't. But he didn't come."</p>

<p>Alice looked at her and laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>"I should have thought he would," she said. She
began to be amused.</p>

<p>"Yes, wouldn't you?" asked Ora. "But he didn't."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've stopped wanting him now. It's quite
unsafe not to keep appointments with me. You miss
the time when you're wanted! Have you seen Irene
Kilnorton anywhere?"</p>

<p>"Not since yesterday."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Some way ahead a carriage
crawled a few paces on; the pack was going to break
up. Ora's victoria got a start first; as it moved she
turned her head over her shoulder, saying:</p>

<p>"I suppose you wouldn't like to come and see me
some day?"</p>

<p>Alice said that she would be delighted, but she felt
that her expression of pleasure in the prospect sounded
purely conventional. In reality she was amazed, inclined
to be apprehensively gratified, and certainly
interested.</p>

<p>"Then do," smiled Miss Pinsent as she was borne
away.</p>

<p>"I wonder who didn't come!" said Alice to herself,
smiling; but the next moment criticism revived. "How
curious she should tell me about it!" she reflected.
"She doesn't know me a bit." Frown and smile stood
on her face together.</p>

<p>The way was cleared. Alice accomplished another
round at a fairly quick trot. Then she saw Miss Pinsent's
victoria again. This time Miss Pinsent was not
alone; the victoria stood by the path and Lord Bowdon's
foot was on the step. He was talking to Ora; Ora leant
back, looking past him with an expression of utter inattention.
Was he the man who didn't come? Or was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
she inattentive because he was not? Alice gave up the
riddle; she had a sudden consciousness that generalisations
which had hitherto seemed tolerably trustworthy
might prove most fallacious if applied to Ora Pinsent.
But there was a distinct regret in her mind when she
lost sight of the little victoria with the big man by its
step. She had her invitation; but in retrospect her
invitation seemed woefully vague.</p>

<p>Ashley dropped in to dinner that evening, pleasant
and talkative as usual, but rather less alert and a trifle
absent in manner. However he had good news; he
was to be secretary to Lord Bowdon's Commission; it
would last a long while, was probably meant to last as
long as the Government did (the grounds for this impression
would be tedious to relate, and open to controversy),
and would enable him to pay bills.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said to Alice, "you don't know
what it is not to be able to pay a bill?"</p>

<p>"I hardly ever have one," she said; "they're just
sent in to father."</p>

<p>"It must be rather slow never to be hard-up," he
remarked; he hardly meant what he said, and was
quite unaware how true his remark seemed to Alice
Muddock. "Then you never write cheques?" he went
on.</p>

<p>"For charity I do."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, what a base use of a cheque book!"</p>

<p>Lady Muddock happened to hear this observation.
She had failed to accustom herself to remarks not meant
for literal acceptance; the Middle Period treats language
seriously.</p>

<p>"We all ought to give a certain proportion," she
remarked. "Oughtn't we, James?" But Sir James
had gone to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>As Ashley sat and talked lightly about the secretaryship,
his shifts to live comfortably beyond his means,
and the welcome help Lord Bowdon had afforded, Alice
felt a surprise at him growing in her. Had she been
placed as he was, she might not have married for money,
but she would inevitably have thought of such a step,
probably have had a severe struggle about it, and certainly
have enjoyed a sense of victory in putting it on
one side. The money-taint had bitten so far into her;
she could disregard wealth but could not forget it. She
hardly understood Ashley; she felt curious to know
what he would say if she stood before him and offered
herself and her thousands freely, unconditionally, the
money without the ribbons. Did he know that she
was ready to do it? Did he want her? There was
an only half-occupied look in his eyes. She never
expected to see admiration gleam in the eyes of men,
but she often, indeed generally, excited interest and
chained attention. To-night there was hardly attention,
certainly not whole-hearted engrossed interest.
All at once, for the first time in her simple sincere
life, there came over her a bitter regret that she was
not pretty. It was a small thing to be; small in itself,
very small in the little changes of shape and colour
that made it. But how rich in consequences! Yes,
she meditated, how unfairly rich!</p>

<p>Pressed by thought, she found herself lapsing into
long silences. She started another line of talk, but the
new topic sprang from the previous meditation.</p>

<p>"I met Miss Pinsent in the Park to-day," she said.
"She was looking so beautiful. And what do you
think, she asked me to go and see her! I was very
flattered."</p>

<p>Ashley smiled as he observed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>"She's asked me to go and see her too."</p>

<p>"Shall you go?" asked Alice, with a grave interest.</p>

<p>She was puzzled at the heartiness of his laugh over
her question.</p>

<p>"Great heavens, of course I shall go," he said, laughing
still.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear Alice, there isn't a man in London
who wouldn't go."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," she said in a disappointed, almost irritable
tone. She had somehow expected a better explanation
than lay in that, something that might apply to
herself, to a girl. She was even sure that there ought
to be something more about Miss Pinsent, that it was a
man's fault if he saw only what all men must see. Her
tone did not escape the quick wit of her companion.</p>

<p>"You must see that she's tremendously interesting?"
he said. "Lady Kilnorton says that Ora Pinsent's the
most interesting person in the world&mdash;except one."</p>

<p>"Except who?"</p>

<p>"Her husband," he answered, laughing again. "You
look surprised. Oh, yes, he exists. His name's Fenning."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she's married?" Alice was leaning forward
now; here was another problem.</p>

<p>"Incredible, but true. You may let Bob meet her
without the least danger of spoiling that great match
he's going to make."</p>

<p>"I'd no idea she was married."</p>

<p>Ashley was obviously amused at her wonder, perhaps
at the importance she attached to the circumstance
which he had brought to her knowledge.</p>

<p>"Lady Kilnorton will have it that he must be a remarkable
man," he went on. "But it doesn't follow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
the least, you know, rather the contrary. Some women
have unimpeachable taste in everything except marriage;
or perhaps we must all have our share of the ordinary,
and they take theirs out in their husbands. Anyhow,
he's at the other end of the world somewhere."</p>

<p>They talked a little while longer about Ora, Alice incidentally
mentioning Bowdon's appearance by the step
of the victoria. Then Ashley said good-night, and
started to walk home to his rooms in one of the streets
which run down from the Strand to the Thames Embankment.
Here he dwelt humbly, commanding modest
comforts and, if he craned his neck, a sidelong view
of a bit of the river by Charing Cross bridge. As he
walked, he was pleasantly and discursively thoughtful.
His evening had disposed him to reflexion on the very
various types of people who inhabited the world and
flocked, one and all, to London. He knew many sorts;
yet within the limits of his acquaintance the Muddocks
were peculiar. And now, right at the other end of the
scale, came this Miss Pinsent. He thought about Miss
Pinsent for a little while, and then drifted idly into a
trivial classification of women according to their external
advantages. Perhaps he had dimly discerned and
caught something of Alice Muddock's train of ideas.
There were those beautiful to all, those pretty to some,
those plain to most. Miss Pinsent, Lady Kilnorton,
Alice Muddock, were the instances on which his generalities
depended. Superficial as the dividing principle was,
he gained a hint of what had come home to Alice while
he talked to her, of the immense difference it made to
the persons divided. (That it made an immense difference
to him was in no way such a discovery as needed
midnight meditation.) To them the difference would
surely become more than a source of greater or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
homage, attention, pleasure, or excitement. These immediate
results must so influence and affect life as to
make the woman in the end really a different being, a
different inner as well as a different outer creature, from
what she would have been had she occupied a place in
another class than her own. It would be curious to take
twin souls (he allowed himself the hypothesis of souls),
put them into diverse kinds of bodies, leave them there
ten years, from eighteen to twenty-eight, say, then take
them out and record the observed variations. But that
was hopeless; the experimental method, admirable for
all sorts of dull subjects, broke down just where it would
become of absorbing interest.</p>

<p>In Pall Mall he met Lord Bowdon coming out of
the Reform Club. Bowdon's family had always been
Whigs; people might argue that historical parties had
changed their policies and their principles; Bowdon was
not to be caught by any such specious reasoning. The
Liberals were heirs to the Whigs; he was heir to his
fathers; his conservative temperament preserved his
Liberal principles. But he did not seem to be occupied
by such matters to-night. He caught Ashley by the
arm, turned him round the Athenæum corner, and began
to stroll gently along towards the steps. Ashley
thanked him again for procuring him the Secretaryship;
Bowdon's only answer was to nod absently. What Alice
Muddock had told him recurred to Ashley's mind.</p>

<p>"I hear you had an audience in the Park to-day," he
said, laughing. "Her Majesty distinguished you?"</p>

<p>"I did a most curious thing," said Bowdon slowly. "I
had an appointment to drive with her. I didn't go.
Half-an-hour later I walked up to the Park and looked
for her till I found her. Doesn't that strike you as a
very silly proceeding?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>"Very," said Ashley with a laugh.</p>

<p>"In a man of forty-three?" pursued Bowdon with a
whimsical gravity.</p>

<p>"Worse and worse. But where do you put the folly,
in missing the appointment or&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in the combination! The combination makes it
hopeless. You said you knew her, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I shouldn't miss the appointment."</p>

<p>Ashley had long been aware of his companion's kindness
for him, one of those partialities that arise without
much apparent reason but are of unquestionable
genuineness. But Bowdon was considered reserved,
and this little outbreak of self-exposure was a surprise.
It shewed that the man was at least playing with a new
emotion; if the emotion grew strong the play might
turn to earnest. Moreover Bowdon must know that his
confidant was a frequent visitor at Lady Kilnorton's.
Bowdon stopped suddenly, standing still on the pavement,
and looking full in Ashley's face.</p>

<p>"Don't think I'm going to make a fool of myself,
my boy," he said with remarkable emphasis and energy.
"Good-night;" and, hailing a cab, he was off in an
instant.</p>

<p>Ashley properly considered his friend's last remark
an indication that he was feeling rather inclined to,
and just possibly might, make or try to make (for often
failure is salvation) a fool of himself. The man of
unshaken sobriety of purpose needs no such protests.
Ashley strolled on to his rooms, decidedly amused,
somehow also a little vexed. Nothing had happened
except a further and needless proof that he had been
right in putting Ora in the first division of his classification.
The vexation, then, remained unaccounted
for, and it was not until he had reached home, lit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
his pipe, mixed his whiskey and water, and settled in
his arm-chair, that he discovered that he was a little
annoyed just because Lord Bowdon was apparently
afraid of making a fool of himself. It was a thing
that Bowdon or any other man had a perfect right to
do, so far as the rest of the world was concerned. This
sounded like a platitude; Ashley was surprised to find
in his own soul an indefinite but not weak opposition
to it. The instinct of exclusive possession was stirring
in him, that resentment of intrusion which is the forerunner
of a claim to property. Well, he was not forty-three
but just thirty. His theory of life did not forbid
a certain amount of making a fool of himself; his
practice had included a rather larger quantity. Perturbation
had been the ruling factor in Bowdon, in Ashley
a pleasurable anticipation was predominant. In his
case there were no very obvious reasons why he should
not make a fool of himself again, if he were so disposed;
for, dealing dispassionately with the situation
and with his own standards, he could not treat this Jack
Fenning as a very obvious reason. He went to bed
with a vague sense of satisfaction; the last few days
had brought to birth a new element in life, or at least
a new feature of this season. It was altogether too
soon to set about measuring the dimensions of the fresh
arrival or settling to what it might or might not grow.</p>

<p>His anticipation would have been much heightened
and the development of his interest quickened had he
been able to see what was at this time happening to the
lady who had made so abrupt and resolute an entry into
his thoughts as well as into Lord Bowdon's. Her distress
would have been sun and water to the growth of his
feelings. For Mr. Sidney Hazlewood, an accomplished
comedian and Ora Pinsent's Manager, had urged that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
she should try, and indeed must force herself, to regard
a certain business arrangement from a purely business
point of view. To Ora, still charged with the emotions
of her performance in addition to her own natural and
large stock of emotions, this suggestion seemed mere
brutality, oblivious of humanity, and dictated solely by
a ruthless and unhallowed pursuit of gain. So she burst
into tears, and a weary wrinkle knitted itself on Mr.
Hazlewood's brow. Lady Kilnorton had been blaming
herself for judging genius from the stand of common-sense;
Mr. Hazlewood did not theorise about the matter;
that eloquent wrinkle was his sole protest against the
existence and the ways of genius. The wrinkle having
failed of effect, he observed that an agreement was an
agreement and spoke, as a man who contemplates regrettable
necessities, of his solicitor. Ora defied Mr. Hazlewood,
the law, and the world, and went home still in
tears. She was not really happy again until she had
got into her dressing-gown, when quite suddenly she
chanced on the idea that Mr. Hazlewood had a good
deal to say for himself. Then she began to laugh
merrily at the scene which had passed between them.</p>

<p>"He's very stupid, but he likes me and he's a good
old creature," she ended in a charitable way.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a><span>CHAPTER III</span>
<span class="smaller">AN ARRANGEMENT FOR SUNDAY</span></h2>


<p>"Elizabeth Aurora Pinsent; that's it. But
Elizabeth was too solemn, and Betty was too
familiar, and Aurora too absurd. So I'm just Ora."</p>

<p>Lord Bowdon nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"And I think," she went on, lying back on the sofa,
"that the world's rather dull, and that you're rather like
the world this afternoon."</p>

<p>He did not dispute the point. A man who wants to
make love, but is withheld by the sense that he ought
not, is at his dullest. Bowdon's state was this or even
worse. Ora was a friend of Irene Kilnorton's; how
much had she guessed, observed, or been told? Would
she think loyalty a duty in herself and disloyalty in him
a reproach? That would almost certainly be her mood
unless she liked him very much; and she gave no sign
of such a liking. On all grounds he was clear that he
had better go away at once and not come back again.
He thought first of Irene Kilnorton, then of his own
peace and interest, lastly of Mr. Jack Fenning; but it
must be stated to his credit that he did think quite
perceptibly of Jack Fenning. Yet he did not go away
immediately.</p>

<p>"You live all alone here?" he asked, looking round
the bright little room.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can, you see. That's the advantage of being
married."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>"I never looked at marriage in that light before."</p>

<p>"No," she laughed. "You've not looked at it in
any light, you know; only from the outer darkness."</p>

<p>As his eyes rested on her lying there in graceful
repose, he felt a grudge against the way fate was treating
him. He wished he were ten or fifteen years
younger; he wished he had nothing to lose; he wished
he had no conscience. Given these desirable things, he
believed that he could break down this indifference and
banish this repose. Ora had done nothing to create
such a belief; it grew out of his own sturdy and usually
justifiable self-confidence.</p>

<p>"Have you a conscience?" he asked her suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered, "afterwards."</p>

<p>"That's a harmless variety," he said wistfully.</p>

<p>"Tiresome, though," she murmured with her eyes
upturned to the ceiling as though she had forgotten
his presence. "Only, you see, something else happens
soon and then you don't think any more about it."
Ora seemed glad that the cold wind of morality was
thus tempered.</p>

<p>Such a remedy was not for the solid-minded man:
he did think more about it, notwithstanding that many
things happened; and his was not merely the harmless
variety of conscience. Ora nestled lower on her
cushions, sighed and closed her eyes; she did not
treat him with ceremony, if any comfort lay in that.
He rose, walked to the window, and looked out. He
felt intolerably absurd, but the perception of his absurdity
did not help him much. Again he complained
of fate. This thing had come just when such things
should cease to come, just also when another thing had
begun to seem so pleasant, so satisfactory, so almost
settled. He was ashamed of himself; as he stood there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
he regretted his midnight confidence to Ashley Mead
a fortnight before. Since then he had made no confidences
to Ashley; he had not told him how often he
came to this house, nor how often he wished to come.
Ora Pinsent's name had not been mentioned between
them, although they had met several times over the
initial business of launching their Commission.</p>

<p>He turned round and found her eyes on him. She
began to laugh, sprang up, ran across the room, laid a
hand lightly on his sleeve, and looked in his face, shaking
her head with an air of determination.</p>

<p>"You must either go, or be a little more amusing,"
she said. "What's the matter? Oh, I know! You're
in love!"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," he admitted with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"Not with me, though!"</p>

<p>"You're sure of that? Nothing would make you
doubt it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought it was Irene Kilnorton," she
answered; her eyes expressed interest and a little
surprise.</p>

<p>"So it was; at least I thought so too," said Bowdon.</p>

<p>"Well, if you think so enough, it's all right," said Ora
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"But I'm inclined to think differently now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't think differently, if I were you," she
murmured. "Irene's so charming and clever. She'd
just suit you."</p>

<p>"You're absolutely right," said Bowdon.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you?" She looked at him for a
moment and he met her gaze; a slight tint of colour
came on her cheeks, and her lips curved in amusement.
"Oh, what nonsense!" she cried a moment later and
drew back from him till she leant against the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
shutter and stood there, smiling at him. The next
moment she went on: "It is quite nonsense, you
know."</p>

<p>Lord Bowdon thought for a moment before he answered
her.</p>

<p>"Nonsense is not the same as nothing," he said
at last.</p>

<p>"You're not serious about it?" she asked with a
passing appearance of alarm. "But of course you
aren't." She began to laugh again.</p>

<p>He was relieved to find that he had betrayed nothing
more decisive than an inclination to flirt. It would be
an excellent thing to sail off under cover of that; she
would not be offended, he would be safe.</p>

<p>"Tragically serious," he answered, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know!" she said. Then she grew grave,
frowned a little and looked down into the street. "You
talk rather like Jack used to. You reminded me of him
for an instant," she remarked. "Though you're not
like him really, of course."</p>

<p>"Your husband?" His tone had surprise in it; she
had never mentioned Jack before; both the moment and
the manner of her present reference to him seemed
strange.</p>

<p>"Yes. You never met him, did you? He used to be
about London five or six years ago."</p>

<p>"No, I never saw him. Where is he now?"</p>

<p>A shrug of her shoulders and a slight smile gave her
answer.</p>

<p>"Why did he go away?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a thousand reasons! It doesn't matter. I liked
him, though, once."</p>

<p>"Do you like him now?"</p>

<p>A moment more of gravity was followed by a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
smile; her eyes sparkled again and she laughed, as she
answered,</p>

<p>"No, not just now, thank you, Lord Bowdon. What
queer questions you ask, don't you?"</p>

<p>"The answers interest me."</p>

<p>"I don't see why they should."</p>

<p>"Don't you?"</p>

<p>"I mean I don't see how they ought."</p>

<p>"Quite so."</p>

<p>"You're really getting a little bit more amusing," said
Ora with a grateful look.</p>

<p>He felt an impulse to be brutal with her, to do, in
another sphere of action, very much what Mr. Hazlewood
had done when he insisted that a business arrangement
must be regarded in a business-like way. Suppose
he told her that questions of morals, with their cognate
problems, ought to be regarded in a moral way? He
would perhaps be a strange preacher, but surely she
would forget that in amazement at the novelty of his
doctrine!</p>

<p>"How old are you?" he asked her, aghast this time
at his question but quite unable to resist it.</p>

<p>She glanced at him for a moment, smiled, and answered
simply,</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven last December."</p>

<p>He was remorseful at having extracted an answer, but
he bowed to her as he said,</p>

<p>"You've paid me a high compliment. You're right,
though; it wasn't impertinence."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you're all right in that way," she murmured
with a careless cordiality. "But why did you want to
know?"</p>

<p>"I want to know all about you," he said in a low
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Again she looked at him for a moment, growing grave
as she looked. Then she laid her hand on his arm
again and looked up in his face with a pleading coaxing
smile.</p>

<p>"Don't," she said.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Then Lord Bowdon
took her hand, kissed it, smiled at her, and asked a prosaic
question.</p>

<p>"Where's my hat?" said he.</p>

<p>But that prosaic question made it impossible to sail
off under cover of an inclination to flirt; it was not at
all in that manner; it lacked the colour, the flourish and
the show. As he walked away, Bowdon was conscious
that whatever happened to the affair, good or evil,
whether it went on or stopped, it must be stamped with
a certain genuineness. It could not pass at once from
his thoughts; he could not suppose that it would be dismissed
immediately from hers.</p>

<p>That he occupied her attention for a little while after
he went away happened to be the case, although it was
by no means the certain result he imagined. A mind
for the moment vacant of new impressions allowed her
to wonder, rather idly, why she had said "Don't" so
soon; he had done nothing to elicit so direct a prohibition;
it had put a stop to a conversation only just
becoming interesting, still far from threatening inconvenience.
Perhaps she was surprised to find her injunction
so effective. She had said the word, she supposed, because
she was not much taken with him; or rather
because she liked him very definitely in one way, and
very definitely not in another, and so had been impelled
to deal fairly with him. Besides he had for a moment
reminded her of Jack Fenning; that also might have
something to do with it. The remembrance of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
husband's love-making was not pleasant to her. It recalled
the greatest of all the blunders into which her
trick of sudden likings had led her, the one apparently
irrevocable blunder. It brought back also the memory
of old delusions which had made the blunder seem something
so very different at the time it was committed.
She walked about the room for a few minutes with a doleful
look, her lips dragged down and her eyes woeful.
It was only five; she did not dine till six. She was supposed
to rest this hour; if resting meant thinking of Jack
Fenning and Lord Bowdon and of the general harshness of
the world, she would have none of it. It occurred to her,
almost as an insult, that here was an hour in which she
was at leisure and yet nobody seemed to desire her
society; such treatment was strange and uncomplimentary.</p>

<p>A ring at the bell scattered her gloom.</p>

<p>"That must be somebody amusing!" she cried,
clasping her hands in the joyful confidence that fate
had taken a turn. "I wonder who it is!"</p>

<p>The visitor thus favoured by a prejudice of approbation
proved to be Ashley Mead. He had come once
before, a week ago; three days back Ora had in her
own mind accused him of neglect and then charitably
congratulated him on indifference. Now she ran to him
as though he were the one person in the world she wished
to see.</p>

<p>"How charming of you!" she cried. "I was bored
to death. I do like people who come at the right
time!"</p>

<p>Ashley held her hand for a moment in sheer pleasure
at the feel of it; they sat down, she again on her sofa,
he in a low chair close by.</p>

<p>"Tea?" she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>"Goodness, no. Don't move from where you are,
Miss Pinsent. I met Lord Bowdon walking away."</p>

<p>"I sent him away."</p>

<p>"What delightful presentiments you have!"</p>

<p>"Indeed I'd no idea that you'd come. I don't think
he wanted to stay, though." She smiled meditatively.
Lord Bowdon's prompt acceptance of her "Don't"
seemed now to take on a humorous air; his hesitation
contrasted so sharply with the confident readiness of
her new visitor.</p>

<p>"I've come on business," said Ashley.</p>

<p>"Business?" she echoed, with an unpleasant reminiscence
of Mr. Sidney Hazlewood and his views as to the
nature of an agreement.</p>

<p>"I want you to help me to organise something."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't. I hate all that sort of thing. It's
not a bazaar, is it?"</p>

<p>"No. Perhaps we might call it a <i>fête</i>. It's a day in
the country, Miss Pinsent."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! Children! You mean those children?"</p>

<p>He leant back in his chair and looked at her before
he replied. She seemed a little hurt and regretful, as
though his visit were not proving so pleasant as she had
expected; a visit should be paid, as virtue should be
practised, for its own sake.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Not those children. These
children."</p>

<p>She took an instant to grasp the proposal; then her
eyes signified her understanding of it; but she did not
answer it.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he urged, leaning forward.</p>

<p>She broke into a light laugh.</p>

<p>"There's no reason why not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's right!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>"Except that I'm not sure I want to," continued
Ora. She put her head a little on one side, with a critical
air. "I wonder if you'd amuse me for a whole
day," she said.</p>

<p>"You quite mistake my point of view," he replied,
smiling. "I never expected to amuse you. I want
you to amuse me. I'm quite selfish about it."</p>

<p>"That's just making use of me," she objected. "I
don't think I was created only to amuse you, you
know."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but let me have the amusement first.
The trouble'll come soon enough."</p>

<p>"Will it? Then why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you understand that well enough really, Miss
Pinsent."</p>

<p>"What would that nice serious girl you're going to
marry say if she heard of our outing?"</p>

<p>"I haven't received the news of my engagement
yet."</p>

<p>"Irene says you're certain to marry her."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate she doesn't say I've done it yet,
does she?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Ora, smiling.</p>

<p>"And that's the point, isn't it? Will you come on
Sunday?"</p>

<p>Sunday had looked rather grey; there was nothing
but a lunch party, to meet a Dean who thought that the
stage might be made an engine for good, and therefore
wished to be introduced to Miss Pinsent. Oh, and
there was a dinner to celebrate somebody's birthday&mdash;she
had forgotten whose. Yes, Sunday was quite a free
day. The sun shone here; it would shine merrily in
the country. In short she wanted to go.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I don't mind trying to prevent you being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
bored for just one day," she said, with her eyes merry
and mocking.</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you," observed Ashley in a
composed tone. "I'll call for you at eleven and carry
you off."</p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>"I shall settle that. It's entirely for my sake we're
going, you know, so I shall have my choice."</p>

<p>"It sounds as if you might enjoy yourself, Mr. Mead."</p>

<p>"Yes, quite, doesn't it?" he answered, laughing.
Ora joined in his laugh; the world was no longer harsh;
Lord Bowdon was nothing; there were no more reminiscences
of the way Jack Fenning used to talk. There
was frolic, there was a touch of adventure, a savour of
mischief.</p>

<p>"It'll be rather fun," she mused softly, clasping her
hands on her knee.</p>

<p>Behind the man's restrained bearing lay a sense of
triumph. He had carried out his little campaign well.
He did not look ahead, the success of the hour served.
No doubt after that Sunday other things would happen
again, and might even be of importance; meanwhile
except that Sunday there was nothing. Merely that
she came was not all&mdash;with her was not even very
much. But he knew that her heart was eager to come,
and that the Sunday was a joy to her also.</p>

<p>"It's dinner-time," she said, springing up. "Go
away, Mr. Mead."</p>

<p>He was as obedient as Bowdon had been; enough
had been done for to-day. But a farewell may be said
in many ways.</p>

<p>"Sunday, then," he said, taking both her hands which
she had held out to him in her cordial fashion. Lady
Kilnorton said that Ora always seemed to expect to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
kissed. "Just manner, of course," she would add, since
Ora was her friend.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sunday&mdash;unless I change my mind. I often
do."</p>

<p>"You won't this time." The assertion had not a shred
of question about it; it was positive and confident.</p>

<p>She looked up in his face, laughing.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said.</p>

<p>Bowdon had kissed her hand, but Ashley did not follow
that example. They enjoyed another laugh together,
and he was laughing still as he left her and took his way
downstairs.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she said, passing her hand over her eyes,
as she went to get ready for dinner. She felt a reaction
from some kind of excitement; yet what reason for
excitement had there been?</p>

<p>With regard to the theatre the Muddock family displayed
a variety of practice. Sir James never went;
Bob frequented with assiduity those houses where the
lighter forms of the drama were presented; Lady Muddock
and Alice were occasional visitors at the highest
class of entertainment. Neither cared much about evenings
so spent as a rule; but Lady Muddock, having
entertained Miss Pinsent, was eager to see her act. Ora
was the only member of her profession whom Lady
Muddock had met; to be acquainted with one of the
performers added a new flavour. Lady Muddock felt
an increased importance in herself as she looked round
the house; there must be a great many people there
who knew nobody on the stage; she knew Miss Pinsent;
she would have liked the fact mentioned, or at any rate
to have it get about in some unobtrusive way. Before
the first act was over she had fully persuaded herself
that Ora had noticed her presence; she had looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
twice quite directly at the box! The little woman,
flattered by this wholly fictitious recognition, decided
audaciously that Sir James' attitude towards the stage
was old-fashioned and rather uncharitable; everybody
was not bad on the stage; she felt sure that there were
exceptions. Anyhow it was nice to know somebody;
it gave one a feeling of what Bob called&mdash;she smiled
shyly to herself&mdash;"being in it." She was very careful
never to talk slang herself, but sometimes it expressed
just what she wanted to say. She pulled out her pink
silk sleeves to their fullest volume (sleeves were large
then) and leant forward in the box.</p>

<p>Between the acts Babba Flint came in. He was a
club acquaintance of Bob's, and had met the ladies of
the family at a charity bazaar. It was a slender basis
for friendship, but Babba was not ceremonious. Nobody
knew why he was called Babba (which was not his name),
but he always was. He was a small fair man, very
smartly dressed; he seldom stopped talking and was
generally considered agreeable. He talked now, and,
seeing the bent of Lady Muddock's interest, he made
Ora his theme. Lady Muddock was a little vexed to
find that Babba also knew Ora, and most of her colleagues
besides; but there was recompense in his string of
anecdotes. Alice was silent, looking and wondering at
Babba&mdash;strange to be such a person!&mdash;and yet listening
to what he was saying. Babba lisped a little; at
least when he said "Miss Pinsent," the S's were blurred
and indistinct. He had met her husband once a long
while ago; "a fellow named Denning, no, Fenning; a
good-looking fellow." "A gentleman?" Babba supposed
so, but deuced hard-up and not very fond of
work. She led him no end of a life, Babba had heard;
so at last he bolted to America or somewhere. Babba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
expressed some surprise that Mr. Fenning did not now
return&mdash;he knew the amount of Ora's salary and mentioned
it by way of enforcing this point&mdash;and declared
that he himself would put up with a good deal at the
hands of a lady so prepossessing as Miss Pinsent. Then
Lady Muddock asked whether Miss Pinsent were really
nice, and Babba said that she wasn't a bad sort to meet
about the place but (Here he broke into a quotation
from a song popular in its day), "You never know what
happens downstairs." Lady Muddock tried to look as
though she had received information, and Babba withdrew,
in order to refresh himself before the rise of the
curtain.</p>

<p>Ora played well that night, indeed played Mr. Hazlewood
off the stage, according to his own confession and
phraseology. There was a ring in her laugh, a rush in
her passion, a triumph in her very walk. Alice found
herself wondering whether what happened to the woman
herself had much effect on her acting, how complete or
incomplete the duality of person was, how much was
put on and put off with the stage dresses and the stage
paint. But, after all, the woman herself must be there
before them, the real creature, full of life and yet straining
her great gift of it to the full. Alice had heard
men described as "living hard." That phrase generally
meant something foolish or disreputable; but you could
live hard without dissipation or folly, at least in the
ordinary sense of those words. You could take all
there was in every hour out of it, put all there was
of you into every hour, taste everything, try everything,
feel everything, always be doing or suffering,
blot out the uneventful stretches of flat country so wide
in most lives, for ever be going up or down, breasting
hills or rattling over the slopes. It must be strange to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
be like that and to live like that. Was it also sweet?
Or very sweet when not too bitter? And when it was
very bitter, what came of it? Surely the mightiest
temptation to lay it all aside and go to sleep? Alice
drew back with a sudden sense of repulsion, as though
there were no health or sanity in such lives and such
people. Then she looked again at the beautiful face,
now strained in sorrow, with hands stretched out in such
marvellous appeal, the whole body a prayer. Her heart
went out in pity, and, with a sudden impulse, cried to go
out in love. But she could come to no final conclusion
about Ora Pinsent, and, vexed at her failure, was thinking
when the curtain fell, "What does it matter to me?"</p>

<p>The arrangement for a Sunday in the country, had
she known of it, might have made the question seem
less simple to answer.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a><span>CHAPTER IV</span>
<span class="smaller">BY WAY OF PRECAUTION</span></h2>


<p>For some days back Irene Kilnorton had been finding
it difficult to have amiable thoughts about Ora.
That they are attractive, that they make a change where
they come, that they are apt to upset what seemed to be
settling itself very comfortably before their arrival, are
not things which can reasonably be imputed as faults to
the persons to whom they are attached as incidents; but
neither do they at all times commend them. It could not
be denied&mdash;at this moment Irene at least could not deny&mdash;that
there was a wantonness about Ora's intrusions;
she went where she might have known it was better that
she should stay away, and pursued acquaintances which
were clearly safer left in an undeveloped state. She was
irresponsible, Lady Kilnorton complained; the grievance
was not unnatural in her since she felt that she was paying
part of the bill; it was Ora's debt really, but Ora
was morally insolvent, and made her friends unwilling
guarantors. The pleasant confidence with which she had
awaited Bowdon's approaches and received his attentions
was shaken; she found that she had wanted him
more than she had thought, that she was less sure of
getting him than she had supposed. He had been to
see her two or three times; there was no falling off in
his courtesies, no abrupt break in his assiduity. But a
cloud hung about him. Being there, he seemed half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
somewhere else; she suspected where the absent half
of his thoughts might be found. He wore an air almost
remorseful and certainly rather apologetic; Lady Kilnorton
did not wish to be courted by way of apology.
She knew it was all Ora Pinsent, and, although she was
quite aware that there was a good deal to be pleaded on
Ora's side of the question, she itched to say something&mdash;no
matter what, provided it were pointed and unpleasant&mdash;about
Jack Fenning. Babba Flint, with
whom she was acquainted, had once described some
young lady to her as his "second-best girl." Babba
was deplorable, most deplorable; yet her anger borrowed
from his strange vocabulary. She did not want
to be anybody's "second-best girl." "Not," she added,
"that I'm a girl at all. No more is Ora, for that matter."
The pleasure of the hit at Ora outweighed the
regret in her admission about herself.</p>

<p>With regard to Ashley Mead her mood was much
lighter, and, as a consequence, much less repressed.
Since she did not care greatly whether he came or
not, she reproached him bitterly for not coming; being
tolerably indifferent as to how he managed his life, she
exhorted him not to be silly; having no concern in the
disposal of his affections, she gave him the best possible
advice as to where he should bestow them. This
conversation happened at Mrs. Pocklington's, where
everybody was, and it seemed to amuse Ashley Mead
very much. But it was Friday night and Sunday was
near, so that everything seemed to amuse and please
him. She told him that Alice Muddock was somewhere
in the rooms; he said that he had already paid his respects
to Alice. Irene's glance charged him with the
blindest folly. "How women are always trying to
give one another away!" he exclaimed. "Oh, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
won't see, you won't," she answered huffishly and leant
back in her chair. The baffled mentor harboured a
grievance! He looked at her for a moment, smiled,
and passed on.</p>

<p>Presently Minna Soames came and sat down by her.
Minna was one of those girls to whom it is impossible
to deny prettiness and impossible to ascribe beauty; she
sang very well and lived very comfortably by her concerts;
she might, of course (or so she said), have made
more on the stage, but then there was the atmosphere.
Irene did not like her much and was inclined to think
her silly. What matter? She began to exercise a circumscribed
power of sarcasm on Ora Pinsent; in spite
of a secret sense of shame, Irene became more and more
gracious. Praise be to those who abuse whom we
would abuse but cannot with propriety!</p>

<p>"I was quite surprised to see her at Lady Muddock's,"
observed Miss Soames with prim maliciousness.</p>

<p>Irene cast a glance at her companion; the remark
was evidently innocent, so far as she was concerned; the
malice was purely for Ora, not for her. Miss Soames
was not aware how Ora had come to be at the Muddocks'!
Irene reached the depths of self-contempt
when, after ten minutes, Minna Soames went away still
in ignorance of this simple fact. "I'm a mean wretch,"
Irene Kilnorton thought; and so at the moment she
was&mdash;as the best of us at certain moments are.</p>

<p>These same moments, in which we see ourselves as
we are most careful that others shall not see us, are not
so pleasant that we seek to prolong them. Irene plunged
into the moving throng with the idea of finding somebody
to talk to her and take her to supper. With some
surprise, some pleasure, and more excitement than she
was willing to admit, she chanced to meet Bowdon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
almost immediately. Her temper rose to the encounter
as though to a challenge. She suggested supper. She
began to find herself in high spirits. The idea was in
her that she would not surrender, would not give up the
game, would not make Ora irresistible by shirking a
fight with her. When they had secured a little table
and sat down she began to talk her best; in this she was
helped by the consciousness of looking her best; she
did not fear to pin his eyes to her with keenest attention.
But the expression of the watching eyes puzzled and
annoyed her; they were eager and yet doubtful, appreciative
but wistful. Was he trying to think her all
he had been on the point of thinking her, still to see
in her all that he wanted? Was he unhappy because
he could not so think and so see? He almost gave her
that impression. She was very gay and felt herself now
almost brilliant; her contest was with that most gay and
brilliant shape which came between his eyes and what
she offered for their allurement. People passing by, in
the usual ignorance and the usual confidence of passers-by,
summed up the situation in a moment; Bowdon was
only waiting for her leave to speak, she was absolutely
confident of him. They envied her and said that she
should not parade her captive quite so openly. She
guessed what they thought; she was glad and was fired
to new efforts. She alone would know how incomplete
was the victory; for all the world she would be triumphant.
Even Ora might think herself defeated! But
why was he changed, why was she less charming to
him, why must she strive and toil and force? In the
midst of her raillery and gaiety she could have put her
hands before her face, and hidden tears.</p>

<p>He was almost persuaded, he was eager to be persuaded.
At this moment she seemed all he wanted; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
told himself angrily and persistently that she was all that
any man could or ought to want, that she stood for the
best and most reasonable thing, for sure happiness and
stable content. If he left her, for what would he leave
her? For utter folly and worse. She would be a wife
to be proud of; there would be no need to apologise for
her. Even had there been no Jack Fenning, he knew
that a marriage with Ora Pinsent would seem even to
himself to need some apology, that he would fear to
see smiles mingled with the congratulations, and to hear
a sunken murmur of sneers and laughter among the
polite applause. He cursed himself for a fool because
he did not on that very instant claim her for his. Why,
the other woman would not even let him make love to
her! He smiled bitterly as he recollected that it was
not open to him to make a fool of himself, even if he
would. He wanted the bad and could not have it, but
because he wanted it vainly, now he was refusing the
good. No raw boy could have sailed further in folly.
Coming to that conclusion he declared he would take a
firm hold on himself. Failing that, his danger was
imminent.</p>

<p>They went up together from the supper-room. Now
she was set to win or for ever to lose; she could not
play such a game twice. "Don't leave me," she said,
boldly and directly. "Everybody here is so tiresome.
Let's go to the little room at the end, it's generally
empty." He appeared to obey her readily, even eagerly,
indeed to be grateful for her invitation; it shewed that
he had not betrayed himself. The little room was
empty and they sat down together. Now he was inclined
to silence and seemed thoughtful. Irene, in
inward tumult, was outwardly no more than excited to
an unusual brightness. After one swift searching glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
at him, she faced the guns and hazarded her assault
against the full force of the enemy. She began to speak
of Ora, dragging her name into the conversation and
keeping it there, in spite of his evident desire to avoid
the topic. Of Ora her friend she said nothing untrue,
nothing scandalous, nothing malicious; she watched
her tongue with a jealous care; conscience was awake
in her; she would have no backbiting to charge herself
with. But she did not see why she should not speak
the truth; so she told herself; both the general truths
that everybody knew and the special truths which intimacy
with Ora Pinsent had revealed to her. Ora spoke
plainly, even recklessly, of others; why should she not
be spoken about plainly, not recklessly, in her turn?
And, no, she said nothing untrue, nothing that she
would not have said to Ora's face, in the very, or almost
the very, same words.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's a strange creature," assented Bowdon.</p>

<p>"Now Ashley Mead's mad about her! But of course
he's only one of a dozen."</p>

<p>Here was dangerous ground; she might have stirred
a jealousy which would have undone all that was begun;
with many men this result would have been almost certain.
But with Bowdon there was wisdom in her line of
attack; she roused pride in him, the haughtiness which
was in his heart though never in his bearing, the instinct
of exclusiveness, the quiet feeling of born superiority to
the crowd, the innate dislike of being one of a dozen, of
scrambling for a prize instead of reaching out to accept
a proffered gift. Ashley Mead, the secretary of his
Commission, his <i>protégé</i>&mdash;and a dozen more! The
memory of his confidence to Ashley became very bitter;
if Ashley were favoured, he would laugh over the recollection
of that talk! He felt eager to shew Ashley that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
it was all no more than a whim, hardly more than a
joke. Well, there was a ready way to shew Ashley that&mdash;and,
he told himself, to shew it to himself too, to
convince himself of it, at least to put it out of his own
power henceforth to question it by word or deed. The
great and the little, the conviction of his mind and the
prick of his vanity, worked together in him.</p>

<p>He was persuaded now that to go forward on this path
would be wise, would make for the worthiness and
dignity of his life, save him from unbecoming follies,
and intrench him from dangers. If only he could again
come to feel the thing sweet as well as wise! There
was much to help him&mdash;his old impulses which now revived,
her unusual brilliancy, the way in which she
seemed to draw to him, to delight in talking to him,
to make of him a friend more intimate than she had
allowed him to consider himself before. He had meant
the thing so definitely a few weeks ago; it seemed
absurd not to mean it now, not to suppose it would be
as pleasant and satisfactory now as it had seemed then.
He had been in a delusion of feeling; here was sanity
coming back again. He caught at it with an eager,
detaining hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly Irene felt that the battle was won; she knew
it clearly in an instant. There was a change in his manner,
his tones, his eyes, his smile. Now he was making
love to her and no longer thinking whether he should
make love to her; and to her he could make love thus
plainly with one purpose only, and only to one end.
She had what she had striven for, in a very little while
now it would be offered to her explicitly. For an instant
she shrank back from plucking the fruit, now that
she had bent the bough down within her reach. There
was a revulsion to shame because she had tried, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
fought, had set her teeth and struggled till she won.
What she had said of Ora Pinsent rose up against her,
declaring that its truth was no honest truth since it was
not spoken honestly. Babba Flint and his horrible
phrase wormed their way back into her mind. But she
rose above these falterings; she would not go back now
that she had won&mdash;had won that triumph which all the
world would suppose to be so complete, and had avoided
that defeat the thought of whose bitterness had armed
her for battle and sustained her in the conflict. In view
of Bowdon's former readiness it would be grossly unfair,
surely, to speak of hers as the common case of a
woman leading a man on; his implied offer had never
been withdrawn; she chose now to accept it; that was
the whole truth about the matter.</p>

<p>He asked her to be his wife with the fire and spirit
of a passion seemingly sincere; she turned to him in a
temporary fit of joy, which made her forget the road by
which she had travelled to her end. Her low-voiced
confession of love made him very glad that he had
spoken, very glad for her sake as well as for his own;
it was a great thing to make her so happy. If he had
refrained, and then found out the anticipations he had
raised in her and how he had taught her to build on him,
he must have acknowledged a grave infraction of his
code. She was, after the first outburst of fearful delight,
very gentle and seemed to plead with him; he answered
the pleading, half unconsciously, by telling her that he
had been so long in finding words because she had encouraged
him so little and kept him in such uncertainty.
When she heard this she turned her face up to his again
with a curiously timid deprecatory affection.</p>

<p>He was for announcing the engagement then and
there, as publicly as possible. His avowed motive was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>
his pride; a desire to commit himself beyond recall, to
establish the fact and make it impregnable, was the
secret spring. Irene would not face the whole assembly,
but agreed that the news should be whispered to chosen
friends.</p>

<p>"It'll come to the same thing in a very little while,"
he said with a relieved laugh.</p>

<p>Before the evening ended, the tidings thus disseminated
reached Ashley Mead, and he hastened to Irene. Bowdon
had left her for the moment, and he detached her
easily from the grasp of a casual bore. His felicitations
lacked nothing in heartiness.</p>

<p>"But it's no surprise," he laughed. "I was only
wondering how long you'd put it off. I mean 'you'
in the singular number."</p>

<p>That was pleasant to hear, just what she wanted to
hear, just what she wished all the world to say. But
she burned to ask him whether he had continued in the
same state of anticipation during the last week or two.
Suddenly he smiled in a meditative way.</p>

<p>"What's amusing you?" she demanded rather sharply.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he answered. He had been thinking of
Bowdon's midnight confidence. He reflected how very
different men were. Some day, no doubt, he himself
would make a proper and reasonable choice; but he
could not have gone so straight from the idea (however
foolish the idea) of Ora Pinsent to the fact of Irene
Kilnorton. It was to lay aside a rapturous lyric and take
up a pleasantly written tale. He found several other
such similes for it, the shadow of Sunday being over his
mind. He was in great spirits and began to talk merrily
and volubly, making fun of his companion, of love, of
engaged folk, and so on. She listened very contentedly
for awhile, but then began to wonder why Bowdon did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
not come back to her; she would have risked absurdity
to be sure that he could not keep away. She knew men
hated that risk above all; but surely he could come
back now and talk to her again? She looked round
and saw him standing alone; then he wanted to come.
With her eyes she gave him a glad invitation; but as
he approached there was a sort of embarrassment in his
manner, a shamefacedness; he was too much a man of
the world to wear that look simply because he had
become a declared lover. And although Ashley was
both cordial and sufficiently respectful there was a distant
twinkle in his eye, as if he were enjoying some
joke. Her apprehensions and her knowledge of the
nature of her triumph made her almost unnaturally
acute to detect the slightest shade of manner in either
of the men. Men knew things about one another which
were kept from women; had Ashley a knowledge which
she lacked? Did it make her triumph seem to him not
incomplete perhaps, but very strange? The glow of
victory even so soon began to give place to discomfort
and restlessness.</p>

<p>Ashley looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I shall go," he announced. "I've been betrayed."
He spoke with a burlesque despair. "A certain lady&mdash;you
can't monopolise the tender affections, Lady Kilnorton&mdash;told
me she would be here&mdash;late. It's late,
in fact very late, and she's not here."</p>

<p>"Who was she?" asked Irene.</p>

<p>"Can you doubt? But I suppose she felt lazy after
the theatre."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ora?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Ashley.</p>

<p>"How silly you are! Isn't he?" She turned to
Bowdon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>"He's very young," said Bowdon, with a smile.
"When he comes to my age&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't say much to-night anyhow, can you?"
laughed Ashley.</p>

<p>"Ora never comes when she says she will."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she does sometimes," Ashley insisted,
thinking of his Sunday.</p>

<p>"You have to go and drag her!"</p>

<p>"That's just what I should do."</p>

<p>No doubt Bowdon took as small a part in the conversation
as he decently could. Still it seemed possible to
talk about Ora; that to Irene's present mood was something
gained. Nobody turned round on her and said,
"He'd rather have had Ora, really," a fantastic occurrence
which had become conceivable to her.</p>

<p>"Your Muddocks have gone, haven't they?" she
asked Ashley.</p>

<p>"Yes, my Muddocks have gone," said Ashley, laughing.
"But why 'my' Muddocks? Am I responsible
for them?"</p>

<p>"They ought to be your Muddocks. I try to get
him to be sensible." The last sentence she addressed
to Bowdon with a smile. "But men won't be."</p>

<p>"None of them?" asked Bowdon, returning her
smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say you're being sensible," she cried,
half-laughing, half-petulantly. "I don't want you to be;
but I think Mr. Mead might."</p>

<p>"Marriage as a precautionary method doesn't recommend
itself to me," said Ashley lightly, as he held out
his hand in farewell. They both laughed and watched
him as he went.</p>

<p>"Silly young man!" she said. "You'll take me to
my carriage, won't you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Ashley might be silly; they were wise. But Wisdom
often goes home troubled, Folly with a light heart. The
hand of the future is needed to vindicate the one and to
confound the other. No doubt it does. The future,
however, is a vague and indefinite period of time.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a><span>CHAPTER V</span>
<span class="smaller">A DAY IN THE COUNTRY</span></h2>


<p>When Ashley Mead called for her at eleven
o'clock on Sunday morning Miss Pinsent was not
dressed. When she made her appearance at a quarter
to twelve she was rather peevish; her repertory embraced
some moods quite unamiable in a light way.
She did not want to go, she said, and she would not go;
she wondered how she had come to say she would go;
was he sure she had said so?</p>

<p>"Oh, you must go now," said Ashley cheerfully and
decisively.</p>

<p>"Why must I, if I don't want to?"</p>

<p>"Honour, justice, kindness, pity; take your choice of
motives. Besides&mdash;" he paused, smiling at her.</p>

<p>"Well, what besides?"</p>

<p>"You mean to go." The stroke was bold, bold as
that of Lady Kilnorton's about Ashley being one of a
dozen.</p>

<p>"Are you a thought-reader, Mr. Mead?"</p>

<p>"A gown-reader on this occasion. If that frock means
anything it means the country."</p>

<p>Ora smiled reluctantly, with a glance down the front
of her gown.</p>

<p>"It's quite true I didn't mean to go," she said.
"Besides I didn't think you'd come."</p>

<p>"A very doubtful truth, and a quite unnecessary
fiction," said he. "Come along."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>She came, obedient but still not gay; he did not
force the talk. They went to Waterloo and took tickets
for a quiet village. He gave her all the Sunday papers
and for a time she read them, while he leant back,
steadily and curiously regarding the white smooth brow
which shewed itself over the top of the sheet. He was
wondering how she kept the traces of her various emotions
(she was credited with so many) off her face. For
lines she might have been a child; for eyes too, it
seemed to him sometimes, while at other moments all
possibilities of feeling, if not of knowledge, spoke in
her glance. After this, it seemed a poor conclusion to
repeat that she was interesting.</p>

<p>Presently she threw away her paper and looked out
of the window with a grave, almost bored, expression.
Still Ashley bided his time; he took up the discarded
journal and read; its pleasant, discursive, unimportant
talk was content with half his mind.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she said absently, "that Irene and Lord
Bowdon are spending the day together somewhere."</p>

<p>"I suppose so; they ought to be, anyhow."</p>

<p>A long pause followed, Ashley still reading his column
of gossip with an appearance of sufficient attention.
Ora glanced at him, her brows raised a little in protest.
At last she seemed to understand the position.</p>

<p>"I'm ready to be agreeable as soon as you are," she
announced.</p>

<p>"Why, then, it's most delightful of you to come,"
was his answer, as he leant forward to her; the paper
fell on the floor and he pushed it away with his foot.
"Will they enjoy themselves, that couple?"</p>

<p>"She wrote to me about it yesterday, quite a long
letter."</p>

<p>"Giving reasons?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>"Yes; reasons of a sort, you know."</p>

<p>"I thought so," he nodded. "Somehow both of
them seemed anxious to have reasons, good sound
reasons."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, but she's in love with him," said Ora. "I
suppose that's a reason."</p>

<p>"And he with her?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>It had been Ora's firm intention not to refer in the
most distant manner to what had passed between Bowdon
and herself. But our lips and eyes are traitors to
our careful tongues; and there are people who draw out
a joke from any hiding-place.</p>

<p>"He's done a very wise thing," said Ashley, looking
straight into her eyes. She blushed and laughed. "I
admire wise things," he added, laughing in his turn.</p>

<p>"But don't do them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sometimes. To-day for example! What can
be wiser than to refresh myself with a day in the country,
to spend a few hours in fresh air and&mdash;and pleasant
surroundings?"</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment, then settled herself
more luxuriously on the seat as she murmured, "I like
being wise too."</p>

<p>The one porter at the little station eyed Ora with
grave appreciation; the landlady of the little inn where
they procured a plain lunch seemed divided between
distrust of the lady and admiration of her garments.
Ashley ordered an early dinner and then invited his
friend to come out of doors.</p>

<p>He had brought her to no show view, no famous
prospect. There was only a low slow stream dawdling
along through the meadows, a belt of trees a quarter of
a mile away behind them, in front a stretch of flat land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
beyond the river, and on the water's edge, here and
there, a few willows. She found a convenient slope in
the bank and sat down, he lying beside her, smoking a
cigar. The sun shone, but the breeze was fresh. Ora
had been merry at lunch but now she became silent
again. When Ashley Mead threw the stump of his
cigar into the stream, she seemed to rouse herself from
a reverie and watched it bob lazily away.</p>

<p>"Sleepy after lunch?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not sleepy," she answered. "I was letting
things pass through my head." She turned to him
rather abruptly. "Why did you bring me here to-day?"
she asked, with a touch of protest in her voice.</p>

<p>"Purely a desire for pleasure; I wanted to enjoy
myself."</p>

<p>"Are you like that too? Because I am." She seemed
to search his face. "But there's something else in you."</p>

<p>"Yes, at other times," he admitted. "But just then
there wasn't, so I brought you. And just now there
isn't."</p>

<p>She laughed, rather nervously as it seemed to him.</p>

<p>"And what do the other things, when they're there,
say to it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're sure of their innings in the end!" His
tone was careless, but his eyes did not leave her face.
He had meant not to make love to her; he would not
have admitted that he was making love to her. But to
have her face there and not look at it had become impossible;
it chained him with its power of exciting that
curiosity mingled with attraction which is roughly
dubbed fascination. He felt that he must not only see
more of her but know more of her; there was a demand
of the brain as well as a craving of the emotions. She
seemed moved to tell him nothing; she made no disclosures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
of her past life, where she had been born or
bred, how she had fared, how come where she was, how
become Mrs. Jack Fenning, or how now again turned
to Ora Pinsent. She left him to find out anything he
wanted to know. Her assumption that there was nothing
to tell, or no reason to tell anything, spurred him to
further study of her. That he studied at his peril he
knew well and had known from the first; it was but
another prick of the spur to him.</p>

<p>She had been gazing across the stream, at the meadows
and the cattle. Now her eyes returned to him and,
meeting his glance, she laughed again in that half-amused,
half-embarrassed way.</p>

<p>"Shall I make up a life for you?" he asked. "Listen
now. You weren't pretty as a young girl; you were
considered very naughty, rather good-for-nothing; I
think they were a bit down on you, tried to drill you
into being like other people, to&mdash;what's the word?&mdash;eradicate
your faults, to give you the virtues. All that
made you rather unhappy; you'd a good deal rather
have been petted. But you weren't drilled, your faults
weren't eradicated, you never got the virtues."</p>

<p>She was listening with a smile and amused eyes.</p>

<p>"The training broke down because you began to grow
beautiful and coaxing; they couldn't drill you any
more; it wasn't in their hearts. They began to see
that they'd got something uncommon; or perhaps they
just despaired. They said it was Ora's way.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lizzie's way," she corrected with a merry nod.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Hang Lizzie! They said it was Ora's
way, and that it was no use bullying the girl. Your
father said it first and had some trouble in convincing
your mother. But he did at last. Then you grew up,
and everybody made love to you. And I expect somebody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
died and home wasn't so comfortable. So some
time or other you took a flight away, and the stage became
a reality. I suppose it had been a dream. And
at some time or other you took a certain step. Then I
don't know anything more except what's written in the
Chronicles of Queen Ora Pinsent." He ended the story,
which had been punctuated by pauses in which he
gathered fresh information from her face.</p>

<p>"You've done well to find out so much. It wasn't
very unlike that. Now tell me the future. What's
going to happen to me?"</p>

<p>"You're going to be young and beautiful for ever
and ever."</p>

<p>She laughed joyfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" she cried. "Let me see. I shall be
young&mdash;young enough&mdash;for ten years more, and with
the proper appliances beautiful for twenty."</p>

<p>His laugh was reluctant; the mention of the proper
appliances jarred on him a little. She saw it in an
instant and answered with a defiance: "I rouge now
when I want it."</p>

<p>"Are you rouged to-day?"</p>

<p>"You can look and see."</p>

<p>"I can look, but perhaps I can't see."</p>

<p>She rubbed her cheek hard with her hand and then
showed him the palm.</p>

<p>"I hope that's proof," he said, "but these contrivances
are so cunning now-a-days."</p>

<p>"Men think them even more cunning than they are,"
laughed Ora. "And what have you done?" she went
on. "What's your life been?"</p>

<p>"The deplorably usual&mdash;preparatory school, public
school, Oxford, Bar. I'm a full-blown specimen of the
ordinary Englishman of the professional classes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>"And what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure I don't know. As little work as I
must and as little harm as I can, I suppose."</p>

<p>She laughed as she said: "At any rate you aren't
doing much work to-day, are you? And no harm at
all! But you've left out what you put in for me&mdash;a
certain step."</p>

<p>"Well, you've taken it, and I haven't."</p>

<p>"You will. Oh, Irene Kilnorton has told me all
about it. It seems you can't help it, Mr. Mead. I
liked her; I asked her to come and see me, but she's
never been."</p>

<p>He made a little grimace, wrinkling brow and nose.
Ora laughed again. "You won't be able to help it,"
she declared, nodding her head. "And then no more
Sundays out with actresses!"</p>

<p>"Even as matters stand, it's not a habit of mine," he
protested.</p>

<p>She smoked a cigarette of his, investing the act of
luxury with a grace which made it meritorious; as she
blew out the last of the smoke, she sighed, saying,</p>

<p>"I wish to-day would last for ever."</p>

<p>"Do you?" he asked in a low voice. The tone
startled her to a sudden quick glance at his face. Her
words had given expression to his longing that this
simple perfection of existence should never pass.</p>

<p>"Just the meadows, and the river, and the sunshine."</p>

<p>"You leave me out?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "you may be somewhere in it, if
you like. Because if nothing was going to change, I
shouldn't change either; and I like you being here
now, so I should like you being here always."</p>

<p>"Do you always expect to change to people?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>"It's not altogether me. They change to me, I
think."</p>

<p>"If I don't change to you, will you promise not to
change to me?" He laughed as he spoke, but he
looked at her intently. She turned away, saying,</p>

<p>"I should be rather afraid never to change to a person.
It would make him mean so terribly much to one,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"But you married?" he whispered, whether in seriousness
or in mockery he himself could hardly tell.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. She seemed to agree that there
was a puzzle, but to be unable to give any explanation
of it. The fact was there, not to be mended by theorising
about it.</p>

<p>In long intimate talk the hours were wearing away.
His impulse was delicately to press her to reveal herself,
to shew her mind, her way of thought, her disposition
towards him. But side by side with his interest came
the growing charm of her; he hardly knew whether to
talk to her or to be silent with her, to elicit and trace
the changes animation made, or to admire the dainty
beauty of her features in repose. Movement and rest
alike became her so well that to drive out either for the
other seemed a gain burdened with an equal loss; her
quick transitions from expression to expression were
ruthless as well as bountiful. She appeared very happy,
forgetful now of the puzzle that he had called to her
mind, of the distrust that had afflicted her, entirely
given over to the pleasure of living and of being there.
Then she liked him; he was no jar, no unwelcome
element. But there was still a distance between them,
marked by her occasional nervousness, her ignoring of
a remark that pressed her too closely, her skirting
round topics which threatened to prove too serious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
She seemed to ask him not to compel her to any issue,
not to make her face any questions or attempt any determination,
to let her go on being happy as long as
might be possible without driving her to ask why she
was happy or how long she would be. Happy she was;
as they rose reluctantly to go back to the inn she turned
to him, saying:</p>

<p>"I shall never forget the day you've given me."</p>

<p>But, arrived at the inn, she forgot her love of the
meadows. Now she was glad to be in the snug parlour,
glad dinner was near, glad to sit in a chair again. She
went upstairs under the escort of the questioning admiring
landlady, and came down fresh and radiant. In
passing she gave him her hand, still cool and moist from
water. "Isn't that nice?" she asked, and laughed merrily
when he answered, "Oh, well, nice enough." The
window opened on a little garden; she flung it wide.
"There's nobody to spy on how much we eat," she
said, "and the evening smells sweet. Oh, do let's
begin!" And she clapped her hands when the meal
came. Ashley found a sort of pity mingling with his
other feelings for her, compassion for the simplicity and
readiness of emotion which expose their possessor to so
many chances of sorrow as well as to a certainty of recurrent
joys. But he fell in with her mood and they
joined in a childish pretence that they were at a great
banquet, dignifying the simple chicken with titles they
recollected from <i>menu</i> or constructed from imagination,
while the claret, which could make no great claims
on intrinsic merit, became a succession of costly vintages,
and the fictitious bill, by which she declared she
would measure his devotion to her, grew by leaps and
bounds. It was strange to realise that in twenty-four
hours she would be back in her theatre, a great, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
least a notorious, personage, talked of, stared at, canvassed,
blamed, admired, the life she herself made so
simple a thing given over to a thousand others for their
pleasure and curiosity. A touch of jealousy made itself
felt in his reflexions.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning rather to hate your audiences," he
said.</p>

<p>A shrug and a smile sent the audiences to a limbo of
inexpressible unimportance.</p>

<p>"You'll think differently about that to-morrow," he
warned her.</p>

<p>"Be content with what I feel to-night; I am."</p>

<p>They had finished dinner; both again had smoked
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"How long before the train?" she asked.</p>

<p>"An hour and a half," he answered with a hint of
triumph in his voice; the end was not yet; even after
the time for the train there was the journey.</p>

<p>Evening fell slowly, as it seemed with a sympathetic
unwillingness to end their day. She moved to an arm-chair
by the side of the window and he sat near her.
Talk died away unmissed and silence came unnoticed.
She looked a little tired and leant back in her seat; her
face shewed pale in the frame of dark hair that clustered
round it; her eyes were larger and more eloquent. The
fate that he had braved, or in truth invited, was come;
he loved her, he so loved her that he must needs touch
her. Yet there was that about her which made his
touch timid and light; a delicacy, an innocence which
he was inclined to call paradoxical, the appeal of helplessness,
a sort of unsubstantiality that made her seem
the love for a man's soul only. One of her hands lay
on the arm of her chair; he laid his lightly on it and
when she turned smiled at her. She smiled back at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>
him with deprecation but with perfect understanding.
She knew why he did that; she did not resent it. She
turned her hand over and very lightly grasped his
fingers in a friendly tender pressure; she gazed again
into the little garden while their hands were thus distantly
clasped. She seemed to yield what she must and
to beg him to ask no more. He longed to be able to do
her will as it was and not to seek to change it, to offer
her no violence of entreaty and to bring her into no
distress. But the sweetness of love's gradual venturing
allured him; it might be still that she only tolerated,
that she gave a return for her day's happiness, and
allowed this much lest she should wound a man she
liked. With that he was not content, he was hotly
and keenly discontent. She had become everything
to him; he must be everything to her; if it must be,
everything in sorrow and renunciation, but everything;
if not for always, at least for now, for the end of this
golden day, everything. He could not go home without
the memory of her lips. He leant forward towards
her; she turned to him. For a moment she smiled, then
grew grave again; she let him draw her nearer to him,
and with averted face and averted eyes suffered his kiss
on her cheek. In the very midst of his emotion he
smiled; she preserved so wonderfully the air of not
being responsible for the thing, of neither accepting
nor rejecting, of being quite passive, of just having it
happen to her. He kissed her again; after much entreaty,
once she kissed him lightly, shyly, under protest
as it were, yet with a sincerity and gladness which
called out a new tenderness in him; they seemed to say
that she had wanted to do it very much long before she
did it, and would want to do it again, and yet would not
do it again. The kiss, which from many women would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
have levelled all barriers, seemed to raise new ones
round her. He was ashamed of himself when his love
drove him to besiege her more. Even now she was
not resentful, she did not upbraid or repel him; she
broke into that little nervous laugh of hers, as she lay
back passive in the chair, and murmured so low that he
hardly caught the words, "Don't. Don't make love to
me any more now."</p>

<p>Her prohibition or request had availed with Bowdon's
hesitating conscience-ridden impulse; perhaps there
was small cause to wonder at that. It availed now no
less with Ashley Mead's impetuous passion. Her low
whisper protected her absolutely; the confession it
hinted disarmed him; he caught both her hands and
held them in a long clasp, looking the while into her
appealing eyes. But he entreated her no more and
he kissed her no more. A moment later he rose, went
and sat on the window-sill, and lit a cigarette; the glow
seemed a tiny beacon of fire to shew the harbour, that
danger was past, that her orders were understood and
accepted. She lay very quiet, looking at him with
steady, grateful, loving eyes, acknowledging a kindness
that she had not doubted and yet found fine in him.
His transgression&mdash;perhaps she hardly counted it one&mdash;was
forgiven because he stayed his steps at her bidding.
He knew that she trusted him; and in spite of
her prohibition he believed that she loved him.</p>

<p>Now one of the riddles about her seemed to find an
explanation. He understood how she had passed
through the dangers and the ordeal, and had come out
still with her freshness and her innocence; how her
taste had saved her from those who would have been
deaf to the appeal that had arrested him, how powerful
and sufficing a shield that appeal was to any man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
whom her taste would allow to come close to her
in comradeship. You could not be false to a confidence
like that; if you were a man who could, you would
never have the chance. Thus Ashley summed up a
case which a little while ago had seemed to him very
strange. It seemed strange and unusual still, with a
peculiar charm of its own. It was weakness breeding
strength, surrender made security. It put a man on
his honour; it took away the resistance which might
make honour forget itself in the passion of victory. It
was like being made guardian of another's treasure;
you were careful of it, however heedless you were of
your own.</p>

<p>As they journeyed home, she was mirthful and joyous.
This day was done, but she did not despair of the
world; there should be other days, and the work of this
day should endure. She made plans by which they
were to meet, to be much together, to unite their lives
by many ties. She let him see how much he had entered
into her schemes; she told him plainly again and
again that he had become to her quite different from
all other men. She revealed to him her little habits,
her tempers, her ways, her man&oelig;uvres, her tricks; she
had plenty of all of them. She shewed an open delight
in the love which she had won from him and made no
pretence of concealing anything of what he was to her.
Of Jack Fenning she said not a word; of caution in the
externals of her own behaviour, of what people might
think or say, of any possible difficulties in their relation
to one another, not a word. She was happy and she
was grateful. He took her to the door of her own
house; she was not hurt but seemed a little surprised
that he would not go in. He did not offer to kiss her
again, but could not avoid thinking that she would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
been neither angry nor grieved if he had. His last
memory was of her looking round her door, smiling
delightedly and nodding to him, her eyes full of a thousand
confidences. "Come soon," she called at last
before she hid herself from his sight.</p>

<p>When he reached his own rooms, he found awaiting
him a note from Sir James Muddock, begging him to
come to the office at Buckingham Palace Road at
eleven the next morning. "I have had an interview
with my doctor," the old man wrote, "which makes it
necessary for me to consider very seriously certain
immediate steps. I hope that I shall be able to rely on
your assistance." The note was sent by hand and
marked "Immediate." Its meaning was plain enough.
The long-expected verdict had come; Sir James must
be relieved; another head was wanted in the firm of
Muddock and Mead. With his brain still full of Ora
Pinsent the matter of the message seemed remote to
Ashley, but he forced himself to descend to it. He was
to have the offer of a partnership, the offer of great
wealth, the opportunity of a career limited only by his
own talents and no longer clogged by poverty. Would
the offer be free, or hampered by a tacit unacknowledged
understanding? He knew well enough Sir
James' mind about his future. How strange that future
looked in the after-glow of this day! Yet what future
had this day? Here was a question that he could not
bring himself to discuss patiently. Future or no future,
this day had altered his life, seemed at this moment to
have altered it so completely that on it and on what had
happened in it would turn his answer to the offer of
great wealth and the prospect of a career. Even in his
own thoughts he observed that reticence about Alice
Muddock which would have governed his tongue in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
speaking of her to another; but, affect as he would, or
thought himself obliged to, he knew that she formed a
factor in the situation, that she was in her father's mind
when he wrote, no less than that other object of the old
man's love, the great firm in Buckingham Palace Road.</p>

<p>"It's strange," he thought, "that the thing, after
dragging on so long, should come to a head now,
to-night, just when&mdash;." He broke off his reflexions
and, going to the window, looked out on the lights of
the bridge and listened to the lessening noise of the
town. He was dimly conscious that in this day of long
idleness, by the slow low river and in the little inn, he
had done more to draw the lines and map the course of
his life than in any hour of labour, however successful
and however strenuous. Fate had surprised him with a
point-blank question, the Stand-and-deliver of a direct
choice. Saying he would think it all over, he sat late
that night. But thoughts will not always be compelled
and disciplined; his vigil was but a pictured repetition
of the day that he had lived. The day had been Ora's
day. Hers also was the night.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a><span>CHAPTER VI</span>
<span class="smaller">AWAY WITH THE RIBBONS!</span></h2>


<p>Few things make the natural man, a being who still
occupies a large apartment in the soul of each of
us, more impatient than to find people refusing to conform
to his idea of the way in which they ought to seek
and find happiness. So far as sane and sensible folk
are concerned&mdash;there is no need to bring the Asylums
into the argument&mdash;his way is the way; deviations from
it, whether perversely deliberate or instinctive and unreasoned,
are so many wanderings from the only right
track. He likes money&mdash;then only fools omit to strive
for it. Stability of mind is his ideal&mdash;what more
wretched than to be tossed from mood to mood? A
regular life is the sole means of preserving health in
stomach and brain&mdash;it is melancholy to see persons
preferring haphazard and ill-regulated existences. Nay,
it makes this natural man rather vexed if we do not like
his furniture, his favourite vegetable, his dentist, and so
forth; his murmured "<i>De gustibus</i>" has a touch of
scorn in it. He conceives a grudge against us for upsetting
established standards of excellence in matters of
life, conduct, upholstery, and the table. Our likings for
people in whom he sees nothing puzzle and annoy him
equally; the shrug with which he says, of a newly married
couple for instance, "They seem very happy," adds
quite clearly, "But on no reasonable grounds have they
a right to be, and in my heart I can't quite believe they
are."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>Sir James Muddock&mdash;once again the occasion of
generalisations&mdash;had never been able to understand
why Ashley Mead did not jump at the chance of Alice
Muddock's hand and a share in Buckingham Palace
Road. The lad was poor, his prospects were uncertain,
at the best they could not yield wealth as Sir James had
learnt to count it; the prejudice against trade is only
against trade on a small scale; any ambitions, social or
political, would be promoted, not thwarted, by his entry
into the firm. As for Alice, she was the best girl in the
world, clever, kind, trustworthy; she was very fond of
him; he was fond of her and appreciated her company.
Ashley was turned thirty; he was not asked to surrender
the liberty of early youth. He had had his fling, and to
sensible men this fling was a temporary episode, to be
enjoyed and done with. It was time for him to get into
harness; the harness offered was very handsome, the
manger well filled, the treatment all that could be desired.
When Sir James summed up the case thus, he had no
suspicion of what had passed during one Sunday in the
country; it is fair to add that it would have made no
difference in his ideas, if he had known of it. The day
in the country with Ora Pinsent would have been
ticketed as part of the fling and thus relegated to after-dinner
memories. Sir James did not understand people
to whom the fling was more than an episode, to whom
all life went on being a series of flings of ever-changing
dice, till at last and only in old age the box fell from
paralysed fingers. Therefore he did not understand all
that was in the nature of Ashley Mead; he would have
understood nothing at all of what was in Ora Pinsent's.</p>

<p>Ashley's decision had taken itself, as it seemed, without
any help or effort on his part. Here was the warrant
of its inevitability. He thought, when he first read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>
the old man's summons, that he was in for a great struggle
and faced with a hard problem, with an anxious weighing
of facts and a curious forecast of possibilities, that
he must sit down to the scrutiny in idleness and solemnity.
But somehow, as he slept or dressed or breakfasted,
between glances at his paper and whiffs of his
pipe, he decided to refuse many thousands a year and to
ignore the implied offer of Alice Muddock's hand. In
themselves thousands were good, there was nothing to
be said against them; and of Alice he had been so fond
and to her so accustomed that for several years back he
had considered her as his most likely wife. She and the
thousands were now dismissed from his life&mdash;both good
things, but not good for him. He sighed once with a
passing wish that he could be different; but being what
he was he felt himself hopelessly at war with Sir James'
scheme as a whole, and with every part of it. Contrast
it with the moods, the thoughts, the atmosphere of life
which had filled his yesterday! And yesterday's was
his native air; thus it seemed to him, and he was so infected
with this air that he did not ask whether but for
yesterday his decision would have been as easy and
unfaltering.</p>

<p>The old man was hurt, grieved, and, in spite of previous
less direct rebuffs, bitterly disappointed; he had
not thought that his offer would be refused when expressly
made; he had not looked to see his hints about
his daughter more openly ignored the more open they
themselves became. His anger expressed itself in an ultimatum;
he flung himself back in his elbow chair, saying,</p>

<p>"Well, my lad, for the last time, take it or leave it.
If you take it, we'll soon put you through your facings, and
then you'll be the best head in the business. But if you
won't have it, I must take in somebody else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>"I know, Sir James. Don't think I expect you to go
on giving me chances."</p>

<p>"If it's not you, it's got to be Bertie Jewett." Bertie
Jewett was Herbert, son of Peter Jewett who had served
through all the changes and lately died as Manager in
Buckingham Palace Road. "He won't refuse, anyhow."
The tone added, "He's not such a fool."</p>

<p>"No, he's not such an ass as I am," said Ashley,
answering the tone and smiling at poor Sir James with
an appealing friendliness.</p>

<p>"That's your word, not mine; but I'm not going to
quarrel with it," said Sir James without a sign of softening.
"What you're after I can't see. What do you want?"</p>

<p>Ashley found himself unable to tell the Head of the
Firm what he wanted.</p>

<p>"I can get along," he said lamely. "I make a bit
writing for the papers, and there's a brief once in a blue
moon; and of course I've got a little; and this secretaryship
helps for the time."</p>

<p>This beggarly catalogue of inadequate means increased
Sir James' scorn and bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Are you above it?" he asked with sudden heat.</p>

<p>"Good God, sir, don't think me a snob as well as an
ass," prayed Ashley.</p>

<p>"Then I don't know what you do want."</p>

<p>Matters seemed to have reached a standstill. But Sir
James had a last shot in his locker.</p>

<p>"Go up and lunch in Kensington Palace Gardens," he
said. "Talk it over with the ladies, talk it over with
Alice."</p>

<p>Ashley wanted to refuse; on this day he had no desire
to see Alice. But refusal seemed impossible.</p>

<p>"All right, Sir James, I will," he said.</p>

<p>"Take a week, take a week more. If you say no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
then, it's Bertie Jewett&mdash;and your chance is gone for
ever. For Heaven's sake don't make a fool of yourself."
Affection mingling with wrath in the entreaty
made it harder to resist.</p>

<p>Ashley walked off with the last words ringing in his
ears; they recalled Lord Bowdon and the Athenæum
corner. After reflexion and against inclination Bowdon
had determined not to make a fool of himself, and had
intrenched his resolution with apparent security against
the possibility of a relapse into a less sensible course.
Here was Ashley's example; but he shied at it.</p>

<p>"And how the devil am I to talk to Alice about
it?" he exclaimed petulantly, as he struck across the
front of Buckingham Palace and headed up Constitution
Hill. There had been a general impression that
he would marry Alice Muddock, and a general impression
about us assumes to ourselves a vaguely obligatory
force. We may not justify it, but we feel the need for
some apology if we refuse. Besides Ashley had, up to
a certain point, shared the impression, although in a
faint far-off way, regarding the suggested alliance not as
the aim of his life but as a possible and not unacceptable
bourn of his youth. His entrance into the firm
was a topic so closely connected that he felt much awkwardness
in discussing it with Alice Muddock. Of her
feelings he thought less than of his own; he was not by
nature a selfish man, but he had now fallen into the
selfishness of a great pre-occupation. The smallest joy
or the lightest sorrow for Ora Pinsent would have filled
his mind. It is difficult to feel in anything like this way
towards more than one person at a time. His sympathy
for Alice Muddock was blunted and he excused its
want of acuteness by an affected modesty which questioned
her concern in him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>It chanced that Lady Kilnorton was at lunch. She
seemed in high spirits and talked vigorously. Her
theme was the artistic temperament; she blamed its
slavishness to the moment. Lady Muddock showed an
anxiety to be furnished with details for purposes of increased
disapproval; Alice was judicial. One man
among three women, Ashley would have been content
to listen, but, when appealed to, he defended the aspersed
disposition. He felt the conversation approaching
Ora Pinsent, step by step; she was in all their minds;
the only case in point known to Lady Muddock, the instance
most interesting to Alice, an unwelcome persistent
presence to Irene, to him a subject to be neither encouraged
nor avoided without risk of self-betrayal. It
was curious how she had come into the circle of their
lives, and having entered seemed to dominate it. But
presently he grew sure of his face and, for the rest, preferred
that they should abuse her rather than not speak
of her; he grudged every abstraction of his thoughts
which banished her image.</p>

<p>The discussion brought its trials. Irene's well-restrained
jealousy and Lady Muddock's inquisitive
disapproval were merely amusing; it was Alice's
judicial attitude which stirred him to resentment. To
assess and assay with this cold-blooded scientific accuracy
seemed inhuman, almost from its excess of science
unscientific, since it was a method so unsuited to the
subject.</p>

<p>"Now take Ora," said Irene, at last grasping the
nettle. "There's nothing she wouldn't do for you at
one moment, the next she wouldn't do anything at all
for you."</p>

<p>"For her acquaintances, you mean?" Alice asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my dear. For anybody, for her best friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
You can't call her either good or bad. She's just fluke,
pure fluke."</p>

<p>"Well, I know it's the thing to pretend not to like
flukes&mdash;" Ashley began. The thin jocularity served for
a shield.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the use of asking a man? He just sees
her face, that's all. Nobody's denying her looks."
Lady Kilnorton seemed petulant.</p>

<p>"Of course a life like hers," observed Lady Muddock,
"is very demoralising."</p>

<p>"My dear Lady Muddock, why?" asked Ashley,
growing exasperated.</p>

<p>"Well, I only know what Minna Soames says, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother dear, Minna Soames is a goose," Alice remarked.
Ashley was grateful, but still with reservations
as to the judicial tone.</p>

<p>Irene Kilnorton, engaged in her secret task of justifying
herself and taking a rosy view of Bowdon's feelings,
talked more for her own ends than for those of the
company.</p>

<p>"That sort of people suit one another very well," she
went on. "They know what to expect of each other.
Harm comes only when people of a different sort get
entangled with them."</p>

<p>"You're vague," said Ashley. "What different sort?"
He had partly fathomed her mood now, and his eyes
were mischievous as he looked at her.</p>

<p>"Sensible people, Mr. Mead." There was a touch of
asperity in the brief retort, which made a thrust from
him seem excusable.</p>

<p>"Suppose Lord Bowdon had never seen you," he
said with plausible gravity, "and, being in that state of
darkness, had fallen in love with Miss Pinsent; would it
have been so very surprising?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>"Very," said Irene Kilnorton.</p>

<p>"And dreadful?"</p>

<p>"Well, bad for him. He'd never have got on with
her and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's Mr. Fenning," interposed Alice with a quiet
laugh. A moment's pause ensued. Ashley had been
startled at the introduction of the name, but he recovered
himself directly.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he said, "of course there's Mr. Fenning.
I'd forgotten him. But he's quite accidental. Leave
him out. He's not part of the case."</p>

<p>"But there's so often a Mr. Fenning," Alice persisted.
"Can he be considered quite accidental?"</p>

<p>Ashley had made much the same remark in different
words to Irene Kilnorton a few weeks before; but remarks
do not bear transplanting.</p>

<p>"Isn't that rather a traditional view?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You mean a prejudiced one?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes."</p>

<p>"I suppose so. But prejudices start somehow, don't
they?" Her smile was very gentle, but still, to his
mind, horribly aloof and judicial. Could she not understand
how a woman might be carried away, and blunder
into a Mr. Fenning, <i>per incuriam</i> and all in a minute (so
to speak)? In such a case was it to be expected that
the Mr. Fenning in question should be all in all to her?
In some ways perhaps she must acknowledge his existence;
but at any rate she needn't Darby-and-Joan it
with him!</p>

<p>"Poor dear Ora!" said Irene Kilnorton after a pause.
Yet she was not naturally malicious any more than
Ashley Mead was naturally selfish. If we are responsible
for the moods we raise in others Miss Pinsent's
account was mounting up. Ashley allowed himself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
retort of a laugh as Lady Muddock rose from the
table.</p>

<p>"I came to talk to you," he said to Alice, as she
passed him.</p>

<p>"Then drink your coffee quick, and come into the
garden," she answered with her usual frank kindness.
When she looked at him her aspect and air became less
judicial.</p>

<p>In the garden he opened the subject of Sir James'
proposal; his eyes were set straight in front of him, hers
on the ground. Her answer would have dismayed Sir
James, and it surprised Ashley. She was energetically,
almost passionately, opposed to his entering the business.</p>

<p>"It's not your line, or your taste, or your proper
work," she said. "What's the good of being rich if
you're doing what you hate all the time?"</p>

<p>"I felt just like that," he said gratefully, "but I was
afraid that I felt like it because I was a fool."</p>

<p>"You can make your own way. Don't sell yourself
to the business."</p>

<p>He glanced at her stealthily; her colour had risen
and her lip trembled. Did she think of anything besides
the business when she bade him not sell himself?
A moment later she laughed uneasily, as, with a reference
to the conversation at lunch, she said,</p>

<p>"You've too much of the artistic temperament for
Buckingham Palace Road."</p>

<p>"I? I the artistic temperament?" He accepted the
trite phrase as a useful enough symbol of what they both
meant.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered steadily. "A good deal of it."</p>

<p>"Then I come under Irene Kilnorton's censures?"</p>

<p>"Under a good many of them, yes."</p>

<p>Something in her manner again annoyed and piqued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
him. She was judging again, and judging him. But
she was interesting him also. She spoke of him; she
knew him well: and just now he was in some doubt about
himself.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," he said, seeking to
draw her out.</p>

<p>"Oh, things carry you away; and you like it. You
don't want to get to a comfortable place and stay there.
I'm not saying anything you mind?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't think so, at least."</p>

<p>She glanced at him full for a moment as she said,</p>

<p>"I never think anything you'd mind, Ashley."
Then she went on hastily. "But you must be prepared
to see Bertie Jewett in great prosperity&mdash;a big house and
so on&mdash;and to know it might all have been yours."</p>

<p>"I'm prepared for that," he said absently. He did
not at all realise the things he was abandoning.</p>

<p>"But of course you'll get on. You'll be something
better than rich."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if I don't&mdash;don't play the fool."</p>

<p>"You keep calling yourself a fool to-day. Why do
you? You're not a fool."</p>

<p>"It's only a way of speaking and not quite my own way,
really," he laughed. "It means if I don't enjoy life a
little instead of spoiling it all by trying to get something
that isn't particularly well worth having; it means, in fact,
if I don't allow scope to my artistic temperament." It
meant also if he did not spend more days in the country
with Ora Pinsent; for though he did not (as he had
hinted) call that folly to himself, he was now on his defence
against a world which would call it folly with no
doubtful voice, and would exhort him earnestly to imitate
Lord Bowdon's decisive measures of self-protection.
It was in the power of this clear-sighted girl thus to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
him on his defence, even in the full swing of his attraction
towards Ora Pinsent; better than anyone, she could
shew him the other side of the picture. He fell into a
silence occupied with puzzled thoughts. She grew
grave, except for a sober little smile; she was thinking
that it was easy to be wise for others, for all the world
except herself; while she was playing the judicial prudent
friend to him, the idea of another part was in her
head. There may be hope without expectation; it
would not have been human in her to hope nothing from
this talk in the garden, to build no fancies on it. But she
rebuked her imagination; whatever it was that filled his
mind&mdash;and his occasional air of distraction had caught
her notice&mdash;she had little share in it, she knew that well.</p>

<p>"The talk at lunch was <i>à propos</i>," she said presently.
"I'm going to call on Miss Pinsent this afternoon."</p>

<p>"You're going to call&mdash;?" The surprise was plain
in his voice. This sudden throwing of the two together
seemed an odd trick of circumstances! His tone brought
her eyes quickly round to him and she looked at him
steadily.</p>

<p>"Why not? She asked me. I told you so," she
said. Ashley could not deny it; he shrugged his
shoulders. "Shan't I like her?"</p>

<p>"Everybody must like her, I think," he answered,
awkward, almost abashed. But then there came on him
a desire to talk about Ora, not so much to justify himself
as to tell another what she was, to exhibit her charm,
to infect a hearer with his own fever. He contrived to
preserve a cool tone, aiming at what might seem a dispassionate
analysis of a fascination which everybody admitted
to exist; but he was at once too copious and too
happy in his description and his images. The girl beside
him listened with that little smile; it could not be merry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
she would not let it grow bitter, but schooled it to the
neutrality of polite attention. She soon saw the state of
his mind and the discovery was hard for her to bear. Yet
it was not so hard as if he had come to tell her of an ordinary
attachment, of a decorous engagement to some
young lady of their common acquaintance, and of a decorous
marriage to follow in due course. Then she
would have asked, "Why her and not me?" With Ora
Pinsent no such question was possible. Neither for
good nor for evil could any comparison be drawn.
And another thought crept in, although she did not give
it willing admittance. Ora was not only exceptional;
she was impossible. Impossibility might be nothing to
him now, but it could not remain nothing forever. The
pain was there, but the disaster not irrevocable. Among
the somewhat strange chances which had marked the
life of Mr. Fenning there was now to be reckoned a
certain shamefaced comfort which he all unwittingly
afforded to Alice Muddock. But Alice was not proud
of the alliance.</p>

<p>Ashley broke off in a mixture of remorse and embarrassment.
His description could not be very grateful to
its hearer; it must have come very near to betraying its
utterer. Alice did not pretend that it left her quite in
the dark; she laughed a little and said jokingly:</p>

<p>"One would think you were in love with her. I suppose
it's that artistic temperament again. Well, this
afternoon I'll look and see whether she's really all you
say. The male judgment needs correction."</p>

<p>As their talk went on he perceived in her a brightening
of spirits, a partial revival of serenity, a sort of relief;
they came as a surprise to him. The lightness with
which she now spoke of Ora appeared, to a large degree
at least, genuine. He did not understand that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
attributed to him, in more sincerity than her manner had
suggested, the temper which had formed the subject of
their half-serious half-jesting talk. Her impression of
him did not make him less attractive to her; he was not
all of the temper she blamed and feared; he had, she persuaded
herself, just enough of it to save him from the
purely ribbon-selling nature and (here came the point
to which she fondly conducted herself) to give her both
hope and patience in regard to her own relations with
him. She could not help picturing herself as the fixed
point to which he would, after his veerings, return in the
end; meanwhile his share of the temperament excused
the veerings. Lady Kilnorton had forced the game with
entire apparent success, but Alice's quick eyes questioned
the real completeness of that victory. She would
play a waiting game. There was no question of an
orthodox marriage with the young lady from over the
way or round the corner, an arrangement which would
have been odious in its commonplace humiliation and
heart-breaking in its orderly finality. But Ora Pinsent
was not a finality, any more than she was the embodiment
of an orderly arrangement. That fortunate impossibility
which attached to her, by virtue of Jack Fenning's
existence, forbade despair, just as her fascination and her
irresistibility seemed to prevent humiliation and lessen
jealousy. The thing was a transient craze, such as
men fell into; it would pass. If she joined her life to
Ashley Mead's she was prepared (so she assured herself)
for such brief wanderings of allegiance, now and then;
as time went on, they would grow fewer and fewer, until
at last she conquered altogether the tendency towards
them. "And she must be ten years older than I am,"
her reflections ended; that the real interval was but
seven did not destroy the importance of the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>Having offered Ashley a lift to Piccadilly, she went off
to get ready, and presently Bowdon, who had called to
pick up Irene, strolled into the garden for a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Hullo, what are you doing here? You ought to be
making your living," he cried good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"I've been throwing it away instead," said Ashley.
"Should you like to be a partner in Muddock and
Mead?"</p>

<p>"A sleeping one," said Bowdon with a meditative
pull at his moustache.</p>

<p>Ashley explained that he would have been expected
to take an active part. Bowdon evidently thought that
he ought to have been glad to take any part, and rebuked
him for his refusal.</p>

<p>"Take the offer and marry the girl," he counselled.
"She'd have you all right, and she seems a very good
sort."</p>

<p>"I don't feel like settling down all of a sudden," said
Ashley with a smile.</p>

<p>They walked side by side for a few paces; then
Bowdon remarked,</p>

<p>"Depend upon it, it's a good thing to do, though."</p>

<p>"It's a question of the best date," said Ashley, much
amused at his companion. "Now at your age, Lord
Bowdon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Confound you, Ashley, I'm not a hundred! I say
it's a good thing to do. And, by Jove, when it means
a lump of money too!"</p>

<p>A pause followed; they walked and smoked in silence.</p>

<p>"Good creatures, women," remarked Bowdon.</p>

<p>Ashley did not find the remark abrupt; he traced its
birth. Alice had left much the same impression behind
her in his mind.</p>

<p>"Awfully," he answered; there was in his voice also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
a note of remorse, of the feeling that comes when we
cannot respond to a kindness so liberally as it deserves.</p>

<p>"Of course they aren't all alike, though," pursued
Bowdon, as though he were reasoning out an intricate
subject and coming on unexpected conclusions. "In
fact they differ curiously, wonderfully."</p>

<p>His thoughts had passed, or were passing, from Irene
Kilnorton to Ora Pinsent; obedient to this guidance
Ashley's followed in a parallel track from Alice Muddock
to Ora Pinsent.</p>

<p>"They're charming in different ways," said he with a
slight laugh. Bowdon shewed no signs of mirth; he
was frowning a little and smoked rather fast.</p>

<p>"And men are often great asses," he observed a few
moments later. Again Ashley had kept pace, but his
face was more doubtful than his companion's and there
was hesitation in his voice as he replied,</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose they are."</p>

<p>This subterranean conversation, shewing above
ground only faint indications of what it really meant to
each of the talkers, had carried them to the end of the
garden. Turning round at the fence, they saw Irene
and Alice walking towards them, side by side. Both
ladies were well dressed, Irene rather brilliantly, Alice
with quiet, subdued good taste; both seemed attractive,
Irene for her bright vivacity and merry kindness,
Alice for her strength of regard and a fine steady
friendliness. A man who was fortunate enough to gain
either of them would win a wife of whom he might
justly be proud when he talked with the enemy in the
gate, and moreover would enjoy an unusually good prospect
of being happy in his own house. The man who had
won one, and the man who could, if he would, win the
other, approached them in a slow leisurely stroll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, great asses," repeated Bowdon in a reflective
tone.</p>

<p>"I didn't say we weren't," protested Ashley Mead
with an irritated laugh.</p>

<p>They would have found a most heartfelt endorsement
of the view which they reluctantly adopted, had Sir
James Muddock known how small a share of Ashley's
visit had been honestly devoted to a consideration of
the advantages of a partnership in Muddock and Mead,
and how much larger a part had been given to a subject
concerning which Sir James could have only one
opinion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a><span>CHAPTER VII</span>
<span class="smaller">UNDER THE NOSEGAY</span></h2>


<p>When Alice Muddock reached Ora's little house
in Chelsea and was shewn into the drawing-room,
she found herself enjoying an introduction to Mr.
Sidney Hazlewood and forced to shake hands with
Babba Flint. Hazlewood struck her favourably; there
was a repressed resolution about him, a suggestion of
being able to get most of what he might happen to
want; no doubt, though, his desires would be limited and
mainly professional. Babba was, as usual, quite inexplicable
to her and almost intolerable. The pair had,
it seemed, come on business, and, after an apology, Ora
went on talking business to them for fully a quarter of
an hour. She was in a businesslike, even a commercial
money-grubbing mood; so were the men; amid a
number of technical terms which fell on Alice's ignorant
ears the question of what they would make was always
coming uppermost. There was indeed a touch of insincerity
in Ora's graspingness; it did not seem exactly
affectation, but rather like a part for which she was cast
on this occasion and into which she threw herself with
artistic zeal. She had to play up to her companions.
There was in her neither the quiet absorption in the
pecuniary aspect which marked Mr. Hazlewood, nor
the tremulous eagerness with which Babba counted imaginary
thousands, the fruit of presupposed successes.
Hazlewood, a clean-shaven hard-lined man of close on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
fifty, and Babba with his long moustache, his smooth
cheeks, his dandiness, and his youth, treated Ora exactly
in the same way&mdash;first as a possible partner, then as
a possible property. They told her what she would
make if she became a partner and how much they
could afford to pay her as a property if she would hire
herself out to them. Ora had her alternative capacities
clearly grasped and weighed their relative advantages
with a knowing hand. Alice thought it a strange scene
by which to make her first more intimate study of the
irresistible impossible Miss Pinsent, the Miss Pinsent of
uncontrollable emotions and unknowable whims. What
images the world made of people! Yet somehow, in
the end, had not the world a way of being just right
enough to save its credit?</p>

<p>At last the conference appeared to be about to break
up. Alice was almost sorry; she could have gone on
learning from it.</p>

<p>"Only remember," said Mr. Hazlewood, "that if we
do make a deal, why, it is a deal!"</p>

<p>Ora began to laugh; an agreement was an agreement,
she remembered, and a deal, by parity of reasoning, a
deal. Hazlewood's wrinkle clamoured for seriousness;
hard money was at stake, and over that surely even
genius could look grave.</p>

<p>"Oh, she won't want to cry off this," said Babba with
a sagacious nod.</p>

<p>Alice had never known how Babba lived (any more
than she knew why). It appeared now that he supported
himself by speculations of this description; she fancied
that he asserted himself so much because the other two
seemed to consider him, in the end, rather superfluous;
more than once he had to remind them that he was
indispensable; they yielded the point good-naturedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
She was interrupted in her thoughts by Hazlewood, who
made a suave remark to her and held out his hand with
a low bow. Ora was chaffing Babba about a very large
flower in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Pinsent a good woman of business?" Alice
asked in an impulse of curiosity.</p>

<p>Hazlewood glanced at Ora; she was entirely occupied
with Babba.</p>

<p>"Miss Pinsent," said he, with his overworked but still
expressive smile, "is just exactly what you happen to
find her. But if you call often enough, there'll come a
time when you'll find her with a good head on her
shoulders."</p>

<p>Alice felt vaguely sorry for Mr. Hazlewood; it must
be wearing to deal with such unstable quantities. She
could imagine herself exchanging sympathy with him
on the vagaries of the artistic temperament; would she
grow a wrinkle, of brow or of heart, over Ashley Mead?
Or had she grown one?</p>

<p>"Well, you've had a lot of experience of her, haven't
you?" she asked, laughing, and wondering what he
thought of Ora. His answer expressed no great
affection.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, yes," he sighed, furrowing his brow
again.</p>

<p>Ora darted up to him, put an arm through his, and
clasped her hands over his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Abusing me?" she said, turning her face round to
his. For a moment Alice thought that she was going
to kiss him and hoped vaguely she would not; but she
felt that she did not know the etiquette; it might be
usual.</p>

<p>"Telling the truth," said Mr. Hazlewood with stout
courage; then with pronounced gallantry he raised his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
arm with Ora's hands on it and kissed one of the hands;
his manner now was quite different from his business
manner of a few moments ago; his eyes were different
too, hardly affectionate, but very indulgent.</p>

<p>"He likes me really, you know, though I worry him
dreadfully," said Ora to Alice.</p>

<p>Babba came up; he had been arranging the big
flower before a mirror.</p>

<p>"Seen Lady Kilnorton lately? She's brought it off
with Bowdon, I hear," he said to Alice.</p>

<p>"She's engaged to Lord Bowdon," said Alice stiffly.</p>

<p>"Deuced lucky woman," observed Babba, blind to the
rebuke which lay in Alice's formality of phrase.</p>

<p>"Take him away," Ora commanded Mr. Hazlewood.
"We've done with him and we don't want him any more.
We aren't sure we like him."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, I ain't a bad chap, Miss Pinsent,"
pleaded Babba piteously.</p>

<p>"We're not at all sure we like him," said Ora inexorably.
"Take him away at once, please, Mr. Hazlewood."
And Hazlewood led him out, protesting
bitterly.</p>

<p>For a moment or two Ora moved about, touching the
furniture into the places in which she wanted it, and
fingering the flowers in the vases. Then she came
quickly to Alice, sat down by her side, and cried
expansively,</p>

<p>"It's really charming of you to come. And you're
like&mdash;you're like something&mdash;Oh, I don't know! I
mean you're a lovely change from those men and their
business and their money."</p>

<p>"I like Mr. Hazlewood."</p>

<p>"Oh, so do I. But my life's so much Mr. Hazlewood.
Why did you come?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>"You asked me," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but I hardly thought you'd come."
She darted back to the previous conversation. "I'm
going to make a lot of money, though, and then I'm
going to have a long holiday, and a villa somewhere
in Italy."</p>

<p>"Oh, they won't let you rest long."</p>

<p>"It won't be very long really, because I shall spend
all the money," Ora explained with a smile. "Let's
have some tea."</p>

<p>She rang, and tea was brought by a very respectable
middle-aged woman. Ora addressed her maid as Janet
and gave her a series of orders; Janet listened to them
with a non-committal air, as though she would consider
whether they were reasonable or not, and act according
to her conclusion. Alice noticed that she called her
mistress "Ma'am;" the reference to Mr. Fenning was
very indirect, but it was the first that Alice had ever
heard made in Ora's presence. It seemed to her also
that Janet laid some slight emphasis on the designation,
as though it served, or might be made to serve, some
purpose besides that of indicating the proper respect of
a servant. She found herself wondering whether Janet
dated from the time when Mr. Fenning was still a present
fact and formed a member of the united Fenning household
(which, by the way, was an odd entity to contemplate).
If that were the case, a conversation with Janet
might be very interesting; knowledge might be gained
about the bulwark; Alice had begun to look on Mr.
Fenning as a bulwark&mdash;and to tell herself that she did
no such thing.</p>

<p>A large number of photographs stood on the mantel-piece
and about the room, most of them signed by their
originals. Many were of men; one might be of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
Fenning. A silver frame stood on a little table just by
the sofa. Alice's intuitive perception told her that here
was Ora's favourite place; her traditions caused her to
conclude that the frame (its back was towards her) held
Mr. Fenning's portrait. She was not undiplomatic, only
less diplomatic than many other women; she took a
tour of inspection, saying how pretty the room was and
declaring that she must look closer at the photograph
of an eminent tragedian on the opposite wall. Her return
movement shewed her the face of the portrait
which she had guessed to be Mr. Fenning's; it was that
of her friend Ashley Mead.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ora, "he sent me that yesterday. I was
so glad to have it."</p>

<p>"You gave him a return?" asked Alice with a careless
laugh, the laugh appropriate to the moment.</p>

<p>"He chose one and I wrote on it. Sugar, Miss
Muddock?"</p>

<p>Alice took sugar.</p>

<p>"You've known him ever so long, haven't you?"
asked Ora, handing the cup.</p>

<p>"Ages, ever since we were children. He's very nice
and very clever."</p>

<p>"I've only known him quite a little while." Ora
paused and laughed. "Some people would say that's
why his picture's in the place of honour."</p>

<p>"You like change?" asked Alice. Ashley liked
change also. But Ora made her old defence.</p>

<p>"People change, so of course I change to them."
The explanation did not quite satisfy herself. "Oh, I
don't know," she said impatiently. "Anyhow I haven't
left off liking Ashley yet. I may, you know."</p>

<p>Alice, conscious that she herself in her hostess' position
would have said "Mr. Mead," tried to make the obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
allowances; it was just like that clasping of the
hands round Hazlewood's arm, just like the air of expecting
to be kissed. Fully aware of insurgent prejudices,
she beat them down with a despotic judgment;
she would not follow in the wake of her stepmother
nor adopt the formulas of Minna Soames. Curiously
enough Ora was in somewhat the same or a parallel state
of mind, although she did not realise it so clearly. She
too was struggling to understand and to appreciate.
She was sure she would be friends with Miss Muddock,
if she could get within her guard; but why did people
have guards, or why not drop them when other people
shewed themselves friendly? You might have to keep
the Babba Flints at their distance, no doubt, but even
that was better done by ridicule than by stiffness.</p>

<p>"We still see a good deal of him," said Alice, "although
he has an immense lot of engagements. He
generally comes to lunch on Sunday."</p>

<p>Ora reflected that he had not followed his usual practice
on one Sunday. Alice went on to give a brief description
of Ashley's general relation to the Muddock
family, and referred to her father's wish that he should
enter the business.</p>

<p>"He came to talk to me about it to-day," she said,
"but it wouldn't suit him in the least, and I told him
so."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it wouldn't," cried Ora. "I'm so glad you
told him right."</p>

<p>Their eyes met in a sudden glance. Did they both
know so much of Ashley Mead, of his tastes, his temper,
and what would suit him? An embarrassment arrested
their talk. Alice was conscious that her hostess'
eyes rested on her with an inquisitive glance; it had
just occurred to Ora that in meeting this girl she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>
encountered a part of the life of Ashley Mead hitherto
unknown to her. "What part? How much?" her eyes
seemed to ask. She was not jealous of Alice Muddock,
but she was inclined to be jealous of all that life of
Ashley's of which she knew nothing, which her visitor
had shared. With a sudden longing she yearned for
the inn parlour where he had no other life than a life
with her; the sudden force of the feeling took her unawares
and set her heart beating.</p>

<p>She came again to Alice and sat down by her; silence
had somehow become significant and impossible.</p>

<p>"I like your frock," she said, gently fingering the
stuff. "At least I like it for you. I shouldn't like it
for me."</p>

<p>The relativity of frocks, being, like that of morals, an
extensive and curious subject, detained them for a few
moments and left them with a rather better opinion of
one another. Incidentally it revealed a common scorn of
Minna Soames, who dressed as though she were stately
when she was only pretty; this also knit them together.
But they progressed nearer to liking than to understanding
one another. Small points of agreement, such as
the unsuitability of the business to Ashley and the inappropriateness
of her gowns to Minna Soames, made
intercourse pleasant but could not bridge the gulf between
them; they were no more than hands stretched out
from distant banks.</p>

<p>Alice began to talk of Irene Kilnorton and Bowdon.
While attributing to them all proper happiness and the
finality of attachment incidental to their present position,
she told Ora, with a laugh, that they had all seen how
much Bowdon had been struck with her.</p>

<p>"I think he did like me," said Ora with a ruminative
smile. "He's safe now, isn't he?" she added a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
later. The thought had been Alice's own, but it needed
an effort for her to look at it from Ora's point of view.
To be a danger and to know yourself to be a danger, to
be aware of your perilousness in a matter-of-fact way,
without either exultation or remorse, was a thing quite
outside Alice's experience. On the whole to expect
men to fall in love with you and to be justified in this
anticipation by events would create a life so alien from
hers that she could not realise its incidents or the state
of mind it would create.</p>

<p>"I like Lord Bowdon," said Ora. "But&mdash;" she paused
and went on, laughing, "He's rather too sensible for
me. He'll just suit Irene Kilnorton. But really I must
write and tell him to come and see me. I haven't seen
him since the engagement."</p>

<p>"You'd much better not," was on the tip of Alice's
tongue, but she suspected that the impulse to say it was
born of her still struggling prejudices. "Ask them together,"
she suggested instead.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Ora pathetically. "He'd hate it."</p>

<p>Alice did not see exactly why he should hate it. Engaged
people always went about together; surely
always?</p>

<p>"Were you ever engaged?" Ora went on.</p>

<p>"Never," said Alice with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I've been&mdash;well, of course I have&mdash;and I hated
it."</p>

<p>With curiosity and pleasure Alice found herself on
the threshold of the subject of Mr. Fenning. But Ora
turned aside without entering the hidden precincts.</p>

<p>"And I'm sure I should hate it worse now. You
wouldn't like it, would you?"</p>

<p>"I should like it very much, if I cared for the man."</p>

<p>"Well," Ora conceded, "he might make it endurable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>
if he treated it properly. Most men look so solemn
over it. As soon as they've got you, they set to work
to make you think what a tremendous thing you've
done. As if that was the way to enjoy yourself!" She
paused, seemed to think, smiled out of the window, and
then, turning to Alice, said with an innocence evidently
genuine, "Ashley Mead would make it rather pleasant,
I think."</p>

<p>The trial was sudden; Alice had no time to put on
her armour; she felt that her face flushed. Again their
eyes met, as they had when it was agreed that the
business would not suit Ashley. The glance was longer
this time, and after Alice turned away Ora went on
looking at her for several moments. That was it, then;
Irene Kilnorton had not spoken idly or in ignorant gossip.
What she had said fell short of truth, for she had spoken
of an alliance only, not of love. Now Ora knew why
the girl talked so much of Ashley; now she knew also
why the girl shewed such interest in herself. Yes, the
rich Miss Muddock would be Ashley's wife if she were
wooed; besides being rich she was pleasant and clever,
and knew how to dress herself. (This last moral quality
ranked high in Ora's list.) Such an arrangement would
be in all ways very beneficial to Ashley. She wondered
whether Ashley knew how entirely the game was in his
own hands. She felt a sudden and sore pity for Alice,
who had been so cordial and so pleasant and whose
secret she had heedlessly surprised. The cordiality
seemed very generous; there was in it a challenge to
counter-generosity. In an instant the heroic idea of giving
him up to Alice flashed through her brain. This
fine conception was hardly born before she found herself
asking wrathfully whether he would consent to leave
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Alice was herself again; she said that she thought
Mr. Mead might make an engagement very pleasant,
but that such a relation to him would perhaps not be
very exciting to her, since she had known him all her
life. This suppression of emotion was not to Ora's
taste; it burked a scene to which her instinct had
begun to look forward. But as generosity would be at
this point premature (even if it should ever become
tolerable) she was forced to acquiesce. A little later
Alice took her leave with increased friendliness and a
pressing invitation to Ora to come and see her at
Kensington Palace Gardens when there was no party
and they could have another quiet talk together.</p>

<p>Surrender&mdash;or the inn parlour? Generosity or joy?
As an incidental accompaniment, correctness or incorrectness
of conduct? These alternatives presented
themselves to Ora when she was left alone. The <i>rôle</i>
of renunciation had not only obvious recommendations
but also secret attractions. How well she could play
it! She did not exactly tell herself that she could play
it well&mdash;the temperament has its decent reticences&mdash;but
she pictured herself playing it well and wished for
an opportunity to play it. She would have played it
beautifully for Irene Kilnorton's benefit, had that lady
asked her assistance instead of taking the matter into
her own resolute hands. She would have sent Bowdon
away with an exhortation to see his own good and to
forget her, with a fully adequate, nay, a more than
ample, confession of the pain the step was causing her,
but yet with a determination which made the parting
final and Irene's happiness secure. All this vaguely
rehearsed itself in her brain as she lay on the sofa
beside Ashley Mead's portrait in its silver frame. And
her subsequent relations both with Irene and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>
Bowdon would have been touched with an underlying
tenderness and sweetened by the common recollection
of her conduct; even when he had become quite happy
with Irene, even when he had learnt to thank herself,
he would not quite forget what might have been.</p>

<p>Having arrived at this point, Ora burst into a laugh
at her own folly. All that went very well, so very
smoothly and effectively, grouped itself so admirably,
and made such a pretty picture. But she took up the
photograph in the silver frame and looked at it. It
was not Bowdon's likeness but Ashley Mead's; the question,
the real question, was not whether she should give
up Bowdon; fate was not complaisant enough to present
her with a part at once so telling and so easy. It was
not Bowdon with whom she had spent a day in the
country, not Bowdon who had been with her in the
inn parlour, not Bowdon who, Alice Muddock thought,
might make an engagement very pleasant. The grace
of self-knowledge came to her and told her the plain
truth about her pretty picture.</p>

<p>"What a humbug I am!" she cried, as she set down
the photograph.</p>

<p>For the actual opportunity was very different from
the imagined, as rich in effect perhaps, but by no means
so attractive. She still liked her part, but the rest of the
cast was not to her taste; she could still think of the
final interview with a melancholy pleasure, but, with this
distribution of characters, how dull and sad and empty
and intolerable life would be when the final interview
was done! The subsequent relations lost all their
subdued charm; underlying tenderness and common
recollections became flat and unprofitable.</p>

<p>"An awful humbug!" sighed Ora with a plaintive
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>Why were good things so difficult? Because this
thing would be very good&mdash;for him, for poor Alice, for
herself. A reaction from the joy of Sunday came over
her, bringing a sense of fear, almost of guilt. She recollected
with a flash of memory what she had said to
Jack Fenning when they parted in hot anger. "You
needn't be afraid to leave me alone," she had cried
defiantly, and up to now she had justified the boast.
She had been weary and lonely, she had been courted
and tempted, but she had held fast to what she had
said. Her anger and her determination that Jack
should not be in a position to triumph over her had
helped to keep her steps straight. Now these motives
seemed less strong, now the loneliness was greater. If
she sent Ashley away the loneliness would be terrible;
but this meant that the danger in not sending him away
was terrible too, both for him and for her. As she sank
deeper and deeper in depression she told herself that she
was born to unhappiness, but that she might at least try
not to make other people as unhappy as she herself was
doomed to be.</p>

<p>While she still lay on the sofa, in turns pitying, reproaching,
and exhorting herself, Janet came in.</p>

<p>"A letter, ma'am," said Janet. "Your dinner will be
ready in ten minutes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Janet," said Ora, and took the letter. The
handwriting was not known to her; the stamp and postmark
were American; Bridgeport, Conn., the legend
ran. "I don't know anybody in Bridgeport, or in
Conn.&mdash;Conn.?&mdash;Oh, yes, Connecticut," said Ora.</p>

<p>The silver frame stood crooked on the table. Ora
set it straight, looked at the face in it, smiled at some
thought, sighed at the same or some other thought, and
lazily opened the letter from Bridgeport, Conn.; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
supposed it was a communication of a business kind,
or perhaps a request for a photograph or autograph.</p>

<p>"My dear Ora, I have had an accident to my hand,
so get a friend to write this for me. I am here in a
merchant's office, but have had a bit of luck on Wall
Street and am in funds to a modest extent. So I am
going to take a holiday. I shall not come to England
unless you give me leave; but I should like to come
and see you again and pay you a visit. How long I
stayed would depend on circumstances and on what we
decided after we had met. A letter will find me here for
the next month. I hope you will send one inviting me
to come. I would write more if I could write myself;
as it is I will only add that I am very anxious to see
you and am sure I can set right any mistakes that there
have been in the past. Write as soon as you can.
Yours affectionately, Jack."</p>

<p>She turned back to the envelope:&mdash;"Miss Ora Pinsent."
The friend who wrote Jack's letter probably did
not know that he was writing to Jack's wife. Janet knew
Jack's writing, but not the writing of Jack's friend. In
secrecy and privacy Jack's letter had come. She laid
it down beside the portrait in the silver frame, and lay
back again quietly with wide-opened eyes. The clock
ticked away ten minutes; dinner was ready; she lay
still.</p>

<p>Had people a right to rise from the dead like this?
Were they justified, having gone out of life, in coming
back into it under cover of a friend's handwriting and
a postage stamp? They had parted for ever, Jack and
she, most irrevocably, most eagerly, most angrily. A
few lines on a sheet of note paper could not change all
that. He had been dead and gone; at least he had
existed only as a memory and as&mdash;she hardly liked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
say an encumbrance&mdash;as a check, as a limiting fact, as
a difficulty which of necessity barred her from ordering
her doings just as she might have liked to order them.
Now he proposed suddenly to become a fact, a presence,
a part of her again, and stole a hearing for this
proposal in the insidious disguise of a friend's handwriting.
How he chose his time too! In wild fancy
she imputed to him a knowledge of the curious appositeness
of his letter's arrival. It came just when she
was unhappy, torn with doubts, feeling low, yes, and
feeling guilty; just after the revelation of Alice Muddock's
feelings, just after the day in the country, just
while she was saying that, for weal or woe, she could
not send Ashley Mead away. At such a moment she
would not have opened the letter had she known it for
his; but he had had an accident to his hand and the
unknown writing had gained him access.</p>

<p>Janet came in again.</p>

<p>"Your dinner is ready, ma'am," she said, and went
on, "These have come for you, ma'am," laying a nosegay
of roses on the little table beside the portrait in the
silver frame, and the letter from Bridgeport, Conn.</p>

<p>Ora nodded; there was no need to ask whence the
roses came; they were of the colour she had declared
her favourite by the river bank on Sunday. "I'll come
to dinner directly," she said, and seeing Janet's eye on
the letter, she forgot that it was in a friend's handwriting
and pushed it under the nosegay till the roses hid it.
There was nothing to be seen on the table now but the
roses of the colour she loved, and the picture in its
silver frame.</p>

<p>To toy with material symbols of immaterial realities
is pretty enough work for the fancy or the pen. The
symbols are docile and amenable; the letter can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
pushed under the roses till their blooms utterly conceal
it, and neither you nor anybody else can see that it is
there. The picture you do not care about can be locked
away in the drawer, the one you love placed on the
little table by your elbow as you sit in your favourite
seat. Unhappily this artistic arrangement of the symbols
makes no difference at all to the obstinate realities.
They go on existing; they insist on remaining visible
or even obtrusive; audible and even clamorous. The
whole thing is a profitless trick of the fancy or the pen.
Although the letter was pushed under the roses, Jack
Fenning was alive in Bridgeport, Conn., with a desire to
see his wife in his heart, and his passage money across
the Atlantic in his pocket.</p>

<p>As Ora drove down to the theatre that night, she
moaned, "How am I to play with all this worrying
me?" But she played very well indeed. And she was
sorry when the acting was over and she had to go back
to her little house in Chelsea, to the society of the letter
and the roses. But now there was another letter: "I
am coming to-morrow at 3. Be at home. A. M."</p>

<p>"What in the world am I to do?" she asked with
woeful eyes and quivering lip. It seemed to her that
much was being laid on the shoulders of a poor young
woman who asked nothing but to be allowed to perfect
her art and to enjoy her life. It did not occur to her
that the first of these aims is accomplished by few
people, that at any rate a considerable minority fail in
the second, and that the fingers of two hands may count
those who in any generation succeed in both. The
apparent modesty of what she asked of fortune entirely
deceived her. She sat in her dressing-gown and cried
a little before she got into bed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a><span>CHAPTER VIII</span>
<span class="smaller">THE LEGITIMATE CLAIMANT</span></h2>


<p>Ashley Mead did not take the week's consideration
which Sir James had pressed on him. The
same evening he wrote a letter decisively declining to
assume a place at the helm in Buckingham Palace Road.
Sir James, receiving the letter and handing it to Alice,
was disappointed to meet with no sympathy in his expressed
views of its folly. He was nearly angry with his
daughter and frankly furious against Ashley. He was
proud of his daughter and proud of his business; the
refusal left him very sore for both. As soon as he
reached his office he gave vent to his feelings by summoning
Bertie Jewett to his presence and offering him
the position to whose attractions Ashley had been so
culpably blind.</p>

<p>Here there was no refusal. A slim, close-built, dapper
little fellow, with a small fair moustache and small
keen blue eyes, full of self-confidence, perfectly self-controlled,
almost sublimely industrious, patiently ambitious,
Bertie turned away from no responsibilities and let slip
no opportunities. He knew himself Bob Muddock's
superior in brains; he had known of, and secretly
chafed against, the proposed intrusion of Ashley Mead.
Now he was safe, and fortune in his hands. But to
Bertie the beauty of firm ground was not that you can
stand still on it and be comfortable, but that it affords a
good "take-off" when you want to clear an obstacle
which lies between you and a place even more desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
in your eyes. Sir James explained the arrangements
he proposed to make, his big share, Bob's moderate
share, Bertie's small share; the work, as is not unusual,
was to be in an inverse ratio to the share. Then the
old man approached the future. When he was gone
there was a sum of money and a big annuity for Lady
Muddock; subject to that, Bob was to have two-fifths
of his father's share to add to his own; the rest was to
be Alice's. In that future time Alice's share would be
nearly as big as Bob's; the addition of another small
share would give it preponderance. Bertie's blue eye
was very keen as he examined the nature of the ground
he had reached and its capacities in the way of "take-off."
But on going forth from Sir James' office, he
could at first do little but marvel at the madness of
Ashley Mead; for he knew that Ashley might have
taken what he had just received, and he suspected that
the great jump he had begun to meditate would have
been easy to Ashley. For incontestably Alice had
shown favour to Ashley&mdash;and had not shown favour to
Bertie Jewett.</p>

<p>Bob and Bertie lunched together at Bob's club that
day, the occasion allowing a little feasting and relaxation
from toil. The new project touching Alice was not
even distantly approached, but Bertie detected in Bob
a profound dissatisfaction with Ashley Mead. Ashley's
refusal seemed to Bob a slur on the business, and concerning
the business he was very sensitive. He remarked
with mingled asperity and satisfaction that
Ashley had "dished himself all round." The "all
round" indicated something besides the big block in
Buckingham Palace Road, and so was significant and
precious to Bertie Jewett.</p>

<p>"Naturally we aren't pleased," Bob said, assuming to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>
express the collective views of the family. "Fact is,
Ashley's got a bit too much side on, you know."</p>

<p>Bertie Jewett laughed cautiously.</p>

<p>"He doesn't like the shop, I suppose!" Bob pursued
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Sir James is so much annoyed about it,"
remarked Bertie with apparent concern.</p>

<p>"He'll see what a fool he's made of himself some
day," said Bob. Alice was in his mind, but went unmentioned.</p>

<p>Bob's opinion was shared in its entirety by Irene Kilnorton,
who came over to express it to Alice as soon as
the news reached her through Bowdon. Bowdon had
heard it from Ashley himself, they being together on
the business of the Commission. Irene was amazed to
find Alice on Ashley's side and would allow no merit to
her point of view.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it's all wrong," she declared. "It would
have been good for him in every way; it would have
settled him."</p>

<p>"I don't want him settled," said Alice. "Oh, if you
knew how tired I get of the business sometimes! Besides
it will make Mr. Jewett so happy. He takes Ashley's
place, you know, though father won't give him as
big a share as he'd have given Ashley."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall tell Mr. Mead what I think of him."
She paused, hesitating a moment as to whether she
should say a disagreeable thing or not. But she was
annoyed by Alice's attitude and decided to say it.
"Not that he'll care what I say or what anybody says,
except Ora Pinsent," she ended.</p>

<p>"Won't he?" asked Alice. She felt bound to interject
something.</p>

<p>"What a creature she is!" cried Irene. "When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span>
went to see her this morning, I found her in tears.
What about? Oh, I don't know. But I spoke to her
sensibly."</p>

<p>"Poor Miss Pinsent!"</p>

<p>"I said, 'My dear Ora, I suppose you've done
something silly and now you're sorry for yourself. For
goodness' sake, though, don't ask me to be sorry for
you.'"</p>

<p>"Had she asked you?" said Alice with a smile.
Lady Kilnorton took no notice of the question.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she went on scornfully, "that she
wanted to be petted. I wasn't going to pet her."</p>

<p>"I think I should have petted her. She'd be nice to
pet," Alice remarked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Irene seemed to lose patience.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that you and she are going
to make friends?" she exclaimed. "It would be too
absurd."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't we? I liked her rather; at least I
think so."</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness that husband of hers would
come back and look after her. What's more, I said
so to her; but she only went on crying more and
more."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to have been very pleasant," Alice
observed.</p>

<p>"I suppose I wasn't," Irene admitted, half in remorse.
"But that sort of person does annoy me so. As I was
saying to Frank, you never know where to have them.
Oh, but Ora doesn't mind it from me."</p>

<p>"Then why did she cry more and more?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;unless it was because I reminded
her of Mr. Fenning's existence. I think it's a good
thing to do sometimes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>"Perhaps. I'm not sure, though, that I shouldn't
leave it to Mr. Fenning himself."</p>

<p>"My dear, respectability goes for something. The
man's alive, after all."</p>

<p>Alice knew that he was alive and in her heart knew
that she was glad he was alive; but she was sorry that
Ora should be made to cry by being invited to remember
that he was alive. Irene was, presumably, happy
with the man she had chosen; it was a good work leaning
towards supererogation (if such were possible) when
she took Ora's domestic relations under her wing. She
hinted something of this sort.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's what Ashley Mead says; we all know
why he says it," was Irene's mode of receiving the good
advice.</p>

<p>A pause followed; Irene put her arm through Alice's
and they began to walk about the garden. Lady Muddock
was working at her embroidery at the open
window; she was pronouncedly anti-Ashleyan, taking
the colour of her opinions from her husband and even
more from Bob.</p>

<p>"Where's Lord Bowdon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, at his tiresome Commission. He's coming
to tea afterwards. I asked Mr. Mead, but he won't
come."</p>

<p>"You'll be happier alone together."</p>

<p>Irene Kilnorton made no answer. She looked faintly
doubtful and a trifle distressed. Presently she made a
general remark.</p>

<p>"It's an awful thing," she said, "to undertake&mdash;to
back yourself, you know&mdash;to live all your life with a
man and never bore him."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you couldn't bore anybody."</p>

<p>"Frank's rather easily bored, I'm afraid."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>"What nonsense! Why, you're making yourself
unhappy just in the same way that Miss Pinsent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do stop talking about Ora Pinsent!" cried
Irene fervently. Then she gave a sudden apprehensive
glance at her companion and blushed a little. "I simply
meant that men wanted such a lot of amusing," she
ended.</p>

<p>In recording her interview with Ora, Irene had somewhat
exaggerated her brutality, just as in her reflexions
about her friend she exaggerated her own common-sense.
Ora drove her into protective measures; she found them
in declaring herself as unlike to Ora as possible. In
reality common-sense held no disproportionate or disagreeable
sway in her soul; if it had, she would have
been entirely content with the position which now
existed, and with her relations towards Bowdon. There
was nothing lacking which this vaunted common-sense
could demand; it was stark sentimentality, and by consequence
such folly as Ora herself might harbour and
drop tears about, which whispered in her heart, saying
that all was nothing so long as she was not for her lover
the first and only woman in the world, so long as she
still felt that she had seized him, not won him, so long
as the mention of Ora's name still brought a look to his
face and a check to his talk. It was against herself
more than against Ora that she had railed in the garden;
Ora had exasperated her because she knew in
herself a temper as unreasonable as Ora's; she harped
on Ora's husband ill-naturedly&mdash;as she went home,
she confessed she had been ill-natured&mdash;because he
who was to be her husband had dreamt of being Ora's
lover. Even now he dared not speak her name, he
dared not see her, he could not trust himself. The
pledge his promised bride had wrung from him was safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
so long as he did not see or let himself think of Ora.
It was thus that Irene read his mind.</p>

<p>She read it rightly&mdash;to his own sorrow and remorse&mdash;rightly.
He was surprised too. About taking the
decisive step he had hesitated; except for circumstances
rather accidentally provocative, perhaps he would not
have taken it. But its virtue and power, if and when
taken, he had not doubted. He had thought that by binding
his actions with the chain of honour he would bind
his feelings with the chain of love, that when his steps
could not wander his fancy also would be tethered, that
he could escape longing by abstinence, and smother a
craving for one by committing himself to seem to crave
for another. The maxims of that common-sense alternately
lauded and reviled by Irene had told him that he
would be successful in all this; he found himself successful
in none of it. Ora would not go; her lure still
drew him; as he sat at his Commission opposite to his
secretary at the bottom of the table, he was jealous
of his secretary. Thus he was restless, uncomfortable,
contemptuous of himself. But he was resolute too.
He was not a man who broke faith or took back his
plighted word. Irene was to be his wife, was as good
as his wife since his pledge was hers; he set himself to
an obstinate fulfilment of his bargain, resolved that she
should see in him nothing but a devoted lover, ignorant
that she saw in him the thing which above all he wished
to hide. Such of Ora's tears as might be apportioned
to the unhappiness she caused to others were just now
tolerably well justified, whatever must be thought of
those which she shed on her own account. Here was
Bowdon restless and contemptuous of himself, Irene
bitter and ashamed, Alice with no surer, no more honest,
comfort than the precarious existence of Mr. Fenning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
Sir James Muddock (Ora was no doubt partly responsible
here also) grievously disappointed and hurt; while
the one person who might be considered to owe her
something, Mr. Bertie Jewett, was as unconscious of
his debt as she of his existence; both would have been
surprised to learn that they had anything in the world
to do with one another. But after all most of Ora's
tears were for herself. Small wonder in face of that
letter from Bridgeport, Connecticut!</p>

<p>Bowdon wished to be married very soon; why wait,
he asked; he was not as young as he had been; it
would be pleasant to go to the country in August man
and wife. In fine the chain of honour gave signs of
being strained, and he proposed to tie up the other leg
with the fetters of law; he wanted to make it more and
more impossible that he should give another thought to
anybody except his affianced wife. In marriage attachment
becomes a habit, daily companionship strengthens
it; surely that was so? And in the country, or, better
still, on a yacht in mid-ocean, how could anything remind
him of anybody else? But Irene would not hasten
the day; she gave many reasons to countervail his; the
one she did not give was a wild desire that he should be
her lover before he became her husband. So on their
feigned issues they discussed the matter.</p>

<p>"The end of July?" he suggested. It was now mid-June.</p>

<p>"Impossible, Frank!" she cried. "Perhaps November."</p>

<p>In September and October Ora would be away.
Two months with Ora away, absolutely away, perhaps
forgotten! Irene built hopes high on these two
months.</p>

<p>"Not till November!" he groaned. The groan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
sounded well; but it meant "Don't leave me free all
that time. Tie me up before then!"</p>

<p>"Ashley Mead seems obstinate in his silly refusal of
Sir James Muddock's offer," she said, anxious to get rid
of the conflict.</p>

<p>"Why should he take it?" asked Bowdon. "He can
get along very well without it; I don't fancy him at the
counter."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's so evidently the sensible thing."</p>

<p>"I've heard you tell him yourself not to go and sell
ribbons."</p>

<p>How exasperating are these reminders!</p>

<p>"I've grown wiser in ever so many ways lately," she
retorted with a smile.</p>

<p>There was an opening for a lover here. She gave it
him with a forlorn hope of its acceptance.</p>

<p>"Yes; but I'm not sure it's a good thing to grow so
very wise," he said. Then he came and sat by her.</p>

<p>"You mustn't be sentimental," she warned him.
"Remember we're elderly people."</p>

<p>He insisted on being rather sentimental; with a keen
jealousy she assessed his sincerity. Sometimes he almost
persuaded her; she prayed so hard to be convinced;
but the wish begot no true conviction. Then
she was within an ace of throwing his pledge back in
his face; but still she clung to her triumph with all its
alloy and all its incompleteness. She had brought him
to say he loved her; could she not bring him in very
truth to love? Why had Ora but to lift a finger while
she put out all her strength in vain? It would not
have consoled her a whit had she been reminded of
Ora's tears. Like most of us, she would have chosen
to win and weep.</p>

<p>As Bowdon strolled slowly back through the Park,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
repeating how charming Irene was and how wise and
fortunate he himself was, he met Ashley Mead. Ashley
was swinging along at a good pace, his coat-tails flying
in the wind behind him. When Bowdon first saw him
he was smiling and his lips were moving, as though he
were talking to himself in a pleasant vein. In response
to his friend's hail, he stopped, looked at his watch, and
announced that he had ten minutes to spare.</p>

<p>"Where are you off to in such a hurry?" asked
Bowdon. Ashley looked openly happy; he had an
air of being content with life, of being sure that he
could make something satisfactory out of it, and of
having forgotten, for the time being at all events,
any incidental drawbacks which might attend on it.
Bowdon was smitten with an affectionate envy, and
regarded the young man with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"Going to see a lady," said Ashley.</p>

<p>"You seem to be making a day of it," observed
Bowdon. "In the morning you refuse a fortune, in
the afternoon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you've heard about the fortune, have you?
I've just been down to Buckingham Palace Road, to
congratulate young Jewett on being in&mdash;and myself on
being out. Now, as I mentioned, Lord Bowdon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now you're on your way to see Miss Pinsent?"</p>

<p>"Right; you've guessed it, my lord," laughed Ashley.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to be ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not."</p>

<p>"You know all about Mr. Fenning?"</p>

<p>"Well, as much as most of us know about him. But
I don't see why I shouldn't take tea with Miss Ora
Pinsent."</p>

<p>Bowdon turned and began to walk slowly along beside
Ashley; Ashley looked at his watch again and resigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
himself to another five minutes. He owed something to
Bowdon; he could spare him five of Ora's minutes; to
confess the truth, moreover, he was a little early, although
he had made up his mind not to be.</p>

<p>"Jewett's the ablest little cad, I know," said Ashley.
"At least I think he's a cad, though I can't exactly
tell you why."</p>

<p>"Of course he's a cad," said Bowdon, who had dined
with Bob Muddock to meet him.</p>

<p>"There's no salient point you can lay hold of,"
mused Ashley; "it's pervasive; you can tell it when
you see him with women, you know; that brings it out.
But he's got a head on his shoulders."</p>

<p>"That's more than can be said for you at this
moment, my friend."</p>

<p>"I'm enjoying myself very much, thank you," said
Ashley with a radiant smile.</p>

<p>"You won't be for long," retorted Bowdon, half in
sorrow, half in the involuntary malice so often aroused
by the sight of gay happiness.</p>

<p>"Look here, you ought to be idiotic yourself just
now," Ashley remonstrated. Then out came his watch
again. The sight of it relieved Bowdon from the fear
that he had betrayed himself; evidently he occupied no
place at all in his companion's thoughts.</p>

<p>"Be off," he said with rueful good-nature. "Only
don't say I didn't tell you."</p>

<p>Ashley laughed, nodded carelessly, and set off again
at his round pace. But presently the round pace
became intolerably slow, and he hailed a hansom. He
was by way of being economical about hansoms, often
pointing out how fares mounted up; but he took a
good many. He was soon landed at the little house in
Chelsea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>Ora was not in the room when Janet ushered him in.
"I'll tell my mistress, sir," said Janet gravely, taking up
a smelling-bottle which stood on Ora's little table and
carrying it off with her. Blind to this subtle indication
that all was not well in the house, Ashley roamed about
the room. He noticed with much satisfaction his portrait
in the silver frame and his roses in a vase; then he looked
at the photographs on the mantel-piece; falling from
these, his eyes rested for a moment in idleness on a
letter which bore the postmark "Bridgeport, Conn."</p>

<p>"Ah, here she is!" he cried, as a step sounded and
the door-handle was turned. Ora entered and closed
the door; but she did not advance towards him; the
smelling-bottle was in her hand.</p>

<p>"I wrote you a note telling you not to come," she
said.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven I didn't get it," he answered cheerfully.
"I haven't been home since the morning. You
can't send me away now, can you?"</p>

<p>Ora walked slowly towards the sofa; he met her half-way
and held out both his hands; she gave him one of
hers in a listless despairing fashion.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know!" said he. "You've been making yourself
unhappy?"</p>

<p>She waved him away gently, and sat down.</p>

<p>"What was in the note you wrote me?" he asked,
standing opposite to her.</p>

<p>"That I could never see you again," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, come!" Ashley expostulated with a laugh.
"That's rather summary, isn't it? What have I done?"</p>

<p>"Irene Kilnorton has been here."</p>

<p>"Ah! And was she disagreeable? She is sometimes&mdash;from
a sense of duty or what she takes for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was disagreeable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>"If that's all&mdash;" he began, taking a step forward.</p>

<p>"That's not all," Ora interrupted. "Are my eyes
red?"</p>

<p>"You've not been crying?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," she retorted, almost angrily. "Oh,
why did I go with you on Sunday? Why did you
make me go?"</p>

<p>She seemed to be conscience-stricken; he drew up a
chair and sat down by her. She did not send him away
now but looked at him appealingly. She had something
of the air that she had worn in the inn parlour,
but there joy had been mingled with her appeal; there
was no joy in her eyes now.</p>

<p>"We didn't do much harm on Sunday," he said.</p>

<p>"I believe I'm preventing you doing what you ought
to do, what all your friends wish for you, what would be
best for you. It's just like me. I can't help it."</p>

<p>"What are you preventing me from doing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know. Irene says you are quite getting to
like her. And she's so nice."</p>

<p>"But Lady Kilnorton's engaged already."</p>

<p>"You know I don't mean Lady Kilnorton. Don't
make fun now, Ashley, don't."</p>

<p>Ashley leant forward suddenly and kissed her cheek.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's not the least use," she moaned disconsolately.
"If that was all that's wanted, I know you'd
do it." A mournful smile appeared on her lips. "But
it only makes it worse. I've made up my mind to
something."</p>

<p>"So have I. I've made up my mind that you're the
most charming woman in the world, and that I don't
care a hang about anything else."</p>

<p>"But you must, you know. We must be reasonable."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see Irene Kilnorton's been very disagreeable!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>"It's not Irene Kilnorton."</p>

<p>"Is it my true happiness, then?"</p>

<p>"No," said Ora, with another fugitive smile. "It's
not exactly your true happiness."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I don't know what it is."</p>

<p>Ora was silent for a moment, her dark eyes filled with
woe.</p>

<p>"There's a letter on the mantel-piece," she said.
"Will you give it to me?"</p>

<p>He rose and took the letter. "This one from
America?" he asked. "I say, you're not going off
there, starring, are you? Because I shall have to come
too, you know."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not going there." She took the letter out
of its envelope. "Read it," she said, and handed it
to him.</p>

<p>Somehow, before he read a word of it, the truth
flashed into his mind. He looked at her and said one
word: "Fenning?"</p>

<p>She nodded and then let her head fall back on the
sofa. He read the letter carefully and jealously; that it
was written by a friend's hand no doubt prevented Jack
Fenning from saying more, as he himself hinted; yet
the colourlessness and restraint of what he wrote were a
comfort to Ashley.</p>

<p>He laid the letter down on the table and looked for a
moment at his own picture. Ora's eyes were on him;
he leant forward, took her hand, and raised it to his lips.</p>

<p>"Poor dear!" said he. Then he folded the letter, put
it in its envelope, laid the envelope on the mantel-piece,
read Bridgeport, Conn., again on the postmark, and, turning,
stood looking down on her. He had not got quite
home to the heart of the situation. All that day long,
as it seemed to him, there had been ineffectual efforts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
stop him, to turn him from his path, and to rescue him
from the impulses which were carrying him along. The
Buckingham Palace Road proposal, Irene Kilnorton's
hints, Alice Muddock's presence, had all been as it were
suggestions to him; he had not heeded the suggestions.
Now came something more categorical, something which
must receive attention and insisted on being heeded.
Mr. Fenning had suddenly stepped out of vagueness
into definiteness, out of a sort of hypothetical into a very
real and pressing form of existence. He was now located
in space at Bridgeport, Connecticut; he was palpable in
his written message; he became urgent for consideration
by virtue of his proposal. Ashley had, in his heart, not
taken Mr. Fenning very seriously; now Mr. Fenning
chose to upset his attitude in that respect in a most decisive
fashion. For whatever Ora decided to do, there
must from now be a difference; Ashley could not doubt
that. She might accept her husband's proposal; in that
case her whole life was changed and his with it. She
might refuse to have anything to do with it; but then
would not the discarded but legitimate claimant on her
affections and her society force her and him out of the
compromise under which they now sheltered themselves?
Either way, Jack Fenning must now be reckoned with;
but which was to be the way?</p>

<p>With a curious sense of surviving ignorance, with an
uncomfortable recognition that he was only at the beginning
of the study and on the outskirts of a knowledge
of the woman whom he already loved and held nearest
to him of anybody in the world, Ashley discovered that
he had no idea in which way Ora would face the situation,
what would be her temper, or what her decision.
For the first time in their acquaintance a flash of discomfort,
almost of apprehension, shot across his mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
Was she as alien, as foreign, as diverse from him as that?
But he would not admit the feeling, would not have it
or recognise it; it was absurd, he told himself, to expect
to foresee her choice, when he knew so little of the factors
which must decide it. Did he know Fenning, had
he been privy to their married life? Not in her but in
the nature of the case lay the puzzle. He dismissed his
doubt and leant down towards the sad beautiful face beside
him.</p>

<p>"Well, dear?" he asked, very gently.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell him to come," said she.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a><span>CHAPTER IX</span>
<span class="smaller">RENUNCIATION: A DRAMA</span></h2>


<p>The words in which Ora declared her intention of
recalling Jack Fenning to her side and of taking
up again the burden of married life sounded like the
statement of a firm, unalterable, and independent resolution;
after them it seemed as though Ashley had only
to bow his head and go his ways; his task would be, if
not easy, yet plain and simple. But with the brave
sound came the appealing glance; the words were uttered
more like a prayer than a decree. She had
thrown herself on his mercy in the inn parlour on the
Sunday; she appeared to throw herself on his mercy
again now, and in reality to await his determination
rather than announce her own. But she was eager to
win from him the verdict that she suggested; she was
not hoping for a refusal while she satisfied appearances
by asking. The appeal was full of fear and doubt, but
it was genuine and sincere. Her eyes followed him as
he walked to the window and as he came back and stood
again before her; she watched the struggle in him with
anxiety. Once she smiled faintly as though to show her
understanding and her sympathy with what was passing
in his mind. "I feel all that too," she seemed to say.</p>

<p>"Have you quite made up your mind?" he asked her
at last. "You've realised what it means? I don't
know him, of course, and you do. Well, can you do it?"</p>

<p>"I must do it. I ought to do it," she said pathetically.
"You know I ought to do it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders; probably she was right
there, unless Jack Fenning were a much worse calamity
than he had any good reason for supposing; certainly
everybody would hold her right, everybody who had
not queer theories, at least.</p>

<p>"You must help me," she said. He was silent. She
rose and came to stand by him, speaking to him in a
low whisper. "Yes, you must help me, you must make
me able to do it. I can do it if you help me, Ashley.
It is right, you know."</p>

<p>A hint of amusement shewed itself in his face.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but I shouldn't have thought I could help
you much," he said. "Unless you mean by going away
and staying away?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," she cried in terror. "You mustn't go
away, you mustn't leave me alone, I should die if you
did that now. It's a thing for both of us to do; we
must help one another. We shall make one another
stronger. Don't you see what I mean? You won't go?"</p>

<p>He had not fathomed her mood yet, but only one
answer to her prayer was possible.</p>

<p>"I won't go as long as you want me," he said.</p>

<p>"You promise? You promise me that?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise," he assured her with another smile.</p>

<p>"And you'll make it easy for me?" She, in her turn,
smiled a moment. "I mean you won't make it too
difficult? I must be good, you must let me be good.
Some people say you're happy when you're good. I
wonder! I shall be very miserable, I know."</p>

<p>The tears were standing in her eyes; she looked indeed
very miserable; he kissed her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, as though he had told her in
words that he pitied her very much; she preserved that
childlike sort of attitude towards caresses; to Ashley it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
seemed to make kissing her almost meritorious. She
saw no inconsistency between accepting his kisses and
holding to her heroic resolution; it seemed almost as
though she must be kissed to enable her to hold to her
resolution; it was the sympathy, or even the commendation,
without which her virtue could not stand.</p>

<p>"I can do it," she said plaintively. Then she drew
herself up a little. "Yes, I can," she repeated proudly,
"I'm sure I can. We can do what we ought, if we try.
Oh, but how I shall hate it! If only it had come a little
sooner&mdash;before&mdash;before our Sunday! It wouldn't have
been so bad, then."</p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't," he said.</p>

<p>"Poor Ashley!" she said, pressing his hand. "Will
it be very hard for you?"</p>

<p>He answered with the shamefaced brevity and reserve
with which men, trained as he had been, confess to
emotion.</p>

<p>"I shan't like it, naturally."</p>

<p>"But you must be strong too," she urged. "We
must make each other strong." She returned with evident
comfort to this idea of their helping one another;
they were to fight as allies, in a joint battle, not each to
support a solitary unaided struggle. To most people it
would have seemed that they would make one another
weak. Ora was sure of the contrary; they would make
one another strong, support one another against temptation,
and applaud one another's successes. She could
be good, could be even heroic, could perform miracles
of duty and resignation, if she had the help of Ashley's
sympathy and the comfort of his presence. And he
would feel the same, she thought; she could soften the
trial to which she was obliged to subject him; she
could console him; her tender grief and her love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>
ardent while renouncing, would inspire him to the task
of duty. She grew eager as this idea took shape in
her mind; she pressed it on him, anxious to make
him see it in the aspect in which she saw it, to understand
the truth and to appreciate the beauty that lay
in it. She was sure it was true. It surprised her to
find this beauty also in it. But if they separated now, cut
themselves adrift from one another, and went off their
different ways, all that drew her in the picture would be
destroyed, and she would be left without the balm of
its melancholy sweetness. She tried by every means in
her power to enlist him on her side and make him look
at the question as she looked at it.</p>

<p>Always obedient to her pleading orders, never able
openly to reject what she prayed him to accept, Ashley
feigned to fall in with an idea which his clearsightedness
shewed very much in its real colours and traced to its
true origin. It had begun in the instinctive desire not
to lose him yet, to put off the day of sacrifice, to reconcile,
so far as might be possible, two inconsistent courses,
to pay duty its lawful tribute and yet keep a secret dole for
the rebel emotion which she loved. Up to this point she
was on ground common enough, and did only what many
men and women seek and strive to do. Her individual
nature shewed itself in the next step, when the idea that
she had made began to attract her, to grow beautiful, to
shape itself into a picture of renunciatory passion, moving
and appealing in her eyes. But there must be other
eyes; he too must see; by interchange of glances they
must share and heighten their appreciation of what they
were engaged on. Her morality, her effort to be, as
she put it, good, must not only be liberally touched by
emotion; it must be supported and stimulated by sympathetic
applause. Reluctantly and almost with a sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
of ungenerousness, as though he were criticising her ill-naturedly,
he found himself applying to her the terms
of her own art, beginning to see her in effective scenes,
to detect an element of the theatrical in her mood. This
notion came to him without bringing with it any repugnance
and without making him impute to her any insincerity.
She was sincere enough, indeed absolutely
engrossed in her emotion and in the picture her emotion
made. But the sincerity was more of emotion than of
purpose, and the emotion demanded applause for the
splendid feat of self-abnegation which it was to enable
her and him to achieve. He was quite incapable of
casting this glamour round his own share in the matter,
but he strove to feel and perceive it in hers as she pleaded
softly with him that he should not leave her to struggle
in grim solitude. And he was glad of any excuse for
not leaving her.</p>

<p>"I can't think yet of what it will be like when he's
come," she said. "I mustn't think of that, or&mdash;or I
couldn't go on. I must just do it now; that's what
we've got to do, isn't it? We must get it done, Ashley,
and leave all the rest. We must just do what's right
without looking beyond it."</p>

<p>"There's no particular good in looking forward," he
admitted ruefully. "You're quite clear about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, aren't you? I'm sure you are." She
looked at him apprehensively. "You mustn't turn
against me. I can be strong with you to help me; I
couldn't be strong against you." Her voice fell even
lower. "Not for an hour," she ended in a whisper.</p>

<p>Again she threw herself on his mercy; again he
could not fail her or be deaf to her prayer.</p>

<p>"If you think it right, I can say nothing against it,"
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>"No. You wouldn't be happy if you did; I mean
if you did persuade me to anything else. I know there
aren't many men like you, capable of doing what you're
going to do for me. But you can do it."</p>

<p>He perceived the glamour encircling him now as well
as her; quarrelling with his own words, still he said to
himself that his part also was to be an effective one; she
was liberal to him and shewed no desire to occupy all
the stage; her eyes would be as much for him as for
herself.</p>

<p>"And because you're strong, I can be strong," she
went on. "We shall both be glad afterwards, shan't we?"</p>

<p>"Let's rest in the consciousness of virtue, and never
mind the gladness," he suggested.</p>

<p>Ora discarded the gladness almost eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Because we shall both be terribly
unhappy. We've got to face that. We aren't doing it
blindly. We know what it means."</p>

<p>He doubted greatly whether she knew what it meant;
she could not realise its meaning so long as she refused
to look forward or to consider the actual state of things
when Jack Fenning had arrived, so long as she preferred
to concentrate all her gaze on the drama of renunciation
which was to precede and bring about his coming. But
in all this there was only an added pathos to him, a
stronger appeal to his compassion, and an insuperable
difficulty in the way of even trying to make her understand;
such an attempt seemed brutal in his eyes. He
could comfort her now; he could not tell her that when
the moving scene ended with the entrance of Jack
Fenning he would be able to comfort her no more.</p>

<p>The same mood which prevented her from looking
forward made her reluctant to talk of her husband as he
actually was. Under pressure of Ashley's questions she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
told him that she had begun by loving Jack and had
gone on liking him for some little while; but that he
bore poverty badly and yet was indolent; that he often
neglected her and sometimes had been unkind; that he
was very extravagant, got into terrible money difficulties,
and had been known to turn to the bottle for relief
from his self-created troubles. But she became very
distressed with the subject and obviously preferred to
leave Jack Fenning vague, to keep him to the part of a
husband in the abstract. This was all the drama needed&mdash;a
husband accepted in duty but no longer loved or desired;
the personal characteristics or peculiarities of the
particular husband were unessential and unimportant.
Ashley was surprised to find how little he had learnt
about Mr. Fenning. But he was learning more about
Mr. Fenning's wife.</p>

<p>"It's not what he is," urged Ora, "it's what we've
got to do."</p>

<p>By now Ashley felt irrevocably coupled with her in
a common task; and to him at least the precise character
of the husband was not important. They were to act on
the high plane of duty; Jack's past misdeeds or present
defects were to be of no moment except in so far as
they might intensify the struggle and enhance the beauty
of renunciation. Ashley was so far infected with her
spirit that he was glad to be left with a number of impressions
of Jack Fenning all vaguely unfavourable.</p>

<p>"Nothing will ever alter or spoil the memory of our
Sunday," she said. "It'll be there always, the one sweet
and perfect thing in life. I think we shall find it even
more perfect because of what we're going to do. I
shall think about it every day as long as I live. I think
it helps to have been happy just once, don't you? It'll
never be as if we hadn't known we loved one another."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>With the dismissal of the topic of Jack Fenning's
character and the acceptance of the position that they
were not to look forward beyond the act of renunciation,
Ora had grown composed, cheerful, and at moments almost
gay. Already she seemed to have triumphed in
her struggle, or their struggle as she always called it;
already she was minded to exchange congratulations
with her ally. Her mere presence was such a charm to
him as to win him to happiness, even while they were
agreeing that happiness was impossible; the sense of
loss, of deprivation, and of emptiness was postponed and
could not assert itself while she moved before his eyes
in the variety of her beauty and grace. Though he
could accord but a very half-hearted adhesion to the
scheme she had planned, again he welcomed it, because
for the time at least it left her to him; nor could he be altogether
sorrowful when she made her great and confessed
love for him the basis on which the whole plan rested,
the postulate that gave to the drama all its point and to
the sacrifice all its merit. If she were triumphing in renunciation,
he triumphed in a victory no less great, and
hardly less sweet because the fruits of it were denied to
him, because it was to rank as a memory, and not to become
a perpetual joy. At least she loved him, trusted
him, depended on him; he was to her more than any
man; he was her choice. He would not have changed
parts with Jack Fenning although he had to go out of
her life and Jack was coming into it again. Surely to
be desired is more than to possess?</p>

<p>"I suppose people suspect about us," she said. "I'm
sure Irene does, and I think Miss Muddock does. But
we've nothing to be ashamed of; we can't help loving
one another and we're going to do right." She paused
a moment, and then, looking at him with a timid smile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span>
added, "How awfully surprised everybody will be when
they hear that Jack's coming back! I think a lot of
them hardly believed in him."</p>

<p>No doubt she divined accurately the nature of a
considerable body of opinion.</p>

<p>"I daresay not," said Ashley. "You'll tell people
what's going to happen?"</p>

<p>"Just my friends. It would look so odd if he came
without any warning."</p>

<p>It could not be denied that she was interested in
thinking of the effect which her news would create.
She saw herself telling it to people.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall announce it as if it was the most
ordinary thing," she went on. "You must do the same;
say I told you about it. They'll be rather puzzled,
won't they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" said he, half laughing, half groaning,
as he took her hand for a moment and pressed it lightly.
"Yes, I daresay they'll be puzzled," he added with a
rueful smile.</p>

<p>"We mustn't shew we notice anything of that sort,"
pursued Ora. "Nobody must see what it is we're
really doing. They won't know anything about it."
Her eyes fixed themselves on his. "I daresay they'll
suspect," she ended. "We can't help that, can we?"</p>

<p>"We must keep our own counsel."</p>

<p>"Yes. If they like to talk, they must, that's all."</p>

<p>She had more to say of this secret of theirs, talked
about, guessed at, canvassed, but not fully understood
and never betrayed; it was to be something exclusively
their own, hidden and sacred, a memory for ever between
them, a puzzle to all the rest of the world.</p>

<p>"I daresay they'll guess that we care for one another,"
she said, "but they'll never know the whole truth. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
expect they wouldn't believe in it if they did. They
wouldn't think we could do what we're going to."</p>

<p>Not till he prepared to go did her sorrow and desolation
again become acutely felt. She held his arms and
prayed him not to leave her.</p>

<p>"You must rest a little while and eat something before
you go to the theatre," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"No, no, don't leave me. Stay with me, do stay with
me. Why can't I always have you with me? Why
shouldn't I? How cruel it is!" She was almost
sobbing. "Ashley, don't go," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't go," he said. "I'll stay and dine with
you and take you to the theatre."</p>

<p>"And fetch me home afterwards?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I'll do that as well."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked resentfully. Ashley shook
his head. After a long look at him Ora sighed deeply.
"I suppose you'd better not," she admitted. "But
you'll stay now, won't you?" She ran across to the
bell and rang it; her tone was gay as she told Janet
that Mr. Mead would dine with her; between being left
now and being left two hours hence a gulf of difference
yawned.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there's not much dinner, ma'am," said
Janet in a discouraging, perhaps a disapproving, way.</p>

<p>"Oh, you won't mind that, will you?" she cried to
Ashley, and when Janet went out she sighed, "It's so
nice to have you." His smile had mockery in it as well
as love. "It's for such a little while too," she went on.
"Presently I shan't have you at all."</p>

<p>The little meal that they took together&mdash;Ashley
ignoring an engagement to dine with friends, Ora seeming
unmindful of things much harder to forget&mdash;was
not a sorrowful feast. The shadow of the great renunciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>
did not eclipse Ora's gaiety, but tempered it with a
soft tenderness. None of her many phases had charmed
her friend more; never had she seemed stronger in her
claim on his service, more irresistible in the weakness
with which she rested her life on his. His taste, his
theoretical taste, had not been for women of this type,
but rather, as he used to put it, for a woman with a
backbone, a woman like Alice Muddock; theoretical
preferences exist to be overthrown.</p>

<p>The unpretentious "jobbed" victoria was waiting at
the door, and at last Ora made up her mind to start. It
was but a little after seven, the streets were still light
and full. The beginning of the renunciation might have
seemed a strange one to the passer-by who recognised
the occupants of the victoria. Many looked at Ora,
thinking they had seen her before; some certainly knew
her, some also knew Ashley. In reply to a not very
serious expostulation from her companion Ora declared
that it did not matter if people gossipped a little, because
her announcement would put an end to it all
directly; meanwhile shouldn't they enjoy themselves
while they could? "If you hadn't taken me to the
theatre to-night, I could never have got there," she
declared with conviction. Ashley knew quite well that
this was not literal truth and that she would have gone
anyhow; whatever had happened to her, her instinct
would have taken her; but the untruth had a truth in it
and she thought it all true. It was an instance of the
way in which she had put herself in his hands, had told
him what she wanted him to do with her, and was now
leaving him to do it. He had, in a slang phrase which
came into his mind, "to see her through;" he had to
ensure that the great renunciation should be properly
carried out. It was consoling, although no doubt somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>
whimsical, that the renunciation should seem to
excuse what but for it would have been condemned as
an imprudence, and, while dooming them to ultimate
separation, should excuse or justify them in being as
much together as they could in the present. It was
"only for a little while;" the coming of Jack Fenning
would end their pleasant hours and silence those who
cavilled at them. The consciousness of their approaching
virtue bred in Ora, and even in Ashley to some
degree, both a sense of security and a tendency to
recklessness; it seemed as though they had had no
reason to fear either themselves or other people.</p>

<p>"You might come and fetch me afterwards," she said
coaxingly.</p>

<p>But here he stood firm and repeated his refusal. She
seemed surprised and a little hurt. But at the moment
Babba Flint lifted his hat and bowed from the pavement
with much <i>empressement</i>.</p>

<p>"The story of our drive will be half over London by
midnight," said Ashley.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter now," she assured him, lightly
touching his hand.</p>

<p>"Shall you write soon?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow," she said. An idea seemed to
strike her. "Hadn't I better telegraph?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that look unnecessarily eager?" he suggested.
The notion of a telegram stirred a jealousy,
not of any real fact, but of the impression that it might
convey to Mr. Fenning. He did not wish Jack Fenning
to suppose that his home-coming was joyously awaited.
Ora had been caught with the attraction of a telegram;
it would emphasise the renunciation; but she understood
the objection.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I'd better write. Because I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
have to explain the reasons for what I'm doing and tell
him how&mdash;how we're to be to one another." She
glanced at Ashley. He was looking straight in front of
him. "I'll shew you the letter," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I don't want to see the letter; I won't see it," he
returned.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is hard for both of us!" she sighed. "But
you know, dear, you know so well what you are to me;
nobody ever has been or ever will be what you are.
Won't you see the letter?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't see the letter."</p>

<p>Ora was disappointed; she would have liked sympathy
and appreciation for the letter. Since these were not
to be had, she determined to send quite a short business-like
letter.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I won't enter on any sort of discussion.
I shall just tell him that I don't feel justified in
refusing him leave to come. That'll be best; afterwards
we must be guided by circumstances."</p>

<p>The "we" amused Ashley, for undoubtedly it served
to couple Ora and himself, not Ora and her husband;
from time to time he awoke for a moment to the queer
humour of the situation.</p>

<p>"We must see how he behaves himself," he said,&mdash;smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes," she assented gravely, but a moment later, seeing
his amusement, she broke into a responsive laugh,
"I know why you're smiling," she said with a little nod,
"but it is like that, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Perhaps for the time it was, but it was very clear to
him that it could not go on being. Professing to think
of nothing but the renunciation, she had begun to construct
an entirely impossible fabric of life on the basis
of it. In this fabric Ashley played a large part; but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
fabric could stand in which both he and Jack Fenning
played large parts; and Jack's part was necessarily large
in any fabric built with the renunciation for its cornerstone.
Else where was the renunciation, where its virtue
and its beauty?</p>

<p>To see the impossibility of a situation and its necessary
tendency to run into an <i>impasse</i> is logically the
forerunner to taking some step to end it. Since, however,
logic is but one of several equal combatants in
human hearts, men often do not act in accordance with
its rules. They wait to have the situation ended for
them from without; a sort of fatalism gains sway over
them and is intensified by every growth of the difficulty
in which they find themselves. Unconvinced by Ora's
scheme and not thoroughly in harmony with her mood,
Ashley acted as though the one satisfied and the other
entirely dominated him. When they parted at the
theatre door there were two understandings arrived at
between them, both suggested by her, both accepted
obediently by him. One was that he should not fail to
come and see her next day, and the day after, and the
day following on that; to this he pledged himself under
sanction of his promise to be her ally in the struggle and
not to forsake her. The other arrangement was that the
letter of recall should be written and despatched to Jack
Fenning within twenty-four hours. Ora reluctantly
agreed that Ashley should not have any hand in its
composition or even see it before it was sent, but she
was sure that she not only must but also ought to render
to him a very clear and full account of all that it did and
did not contain.</p>

<p>"Because," she said, as she gave him her hand in unwilling
farewell, "we're going to fight this battle
together, aren't we?" He nodded. "I couldn't fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span>
it without you, indeed I couldn't," were the last words
she spoke to him; they came with all the added force
of the last imploring look from her eyes and the last
pleading smile on her lips.</p>

<p>Then the theatre swallowed her up, and he was left to
walk home, to remember his neglected engagement, to
telegraph excuses in regard to it, then speedily again
to forget it, and to spend an evening in which despair,
wonder, tenderness, and amusement each had their turn
with him. He had not lost her yet, but he must lose
her; this idea of hers was absurd, ludicrous, impossible,
yet it was also sweet, persuasive, above all expressive of
her in her mingled power and weakness. It was herself;
and from it, therefore, he could no more escape than he
could from her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a><span>CHAPTER X</span>
<span class="smaller">THE LICENCE OF VIRTUE</span></h2>


<p>Irene Kilnorton was in a state of pardonable
irritation; just now she often inclined to irritation,
but the immediate cause of this fit and its sufficient excuse
lay in Babba Flint's behaviour. If only he could
have believed it, he always annoyed her; but it was outrageous
beyond the common to come on her "At
Home" day, and openly scout her most interesting,
most exciting, most comforting piece of news. He
stuck his glass in his eye, stared through it an instant,
and dropped it with an air of contemptuous incredulity.</p>

<p>"She told me herself," said Irene angrily. "I suppose
that's pretty good authority."</p>

<p>"The very worst," retorted Babba calmly. "She's
just the person who has an interest in spreading the
idea. Mind you, I don't say he doesn't exist; I reserve
judgment as to that because I'm aware that he used to.
But I do say he won't turn up, and I'm willing to take
any reasonable bet on the subject. In fact the whole
thing is as plain as a pikestaff."</p>

<p>"What whole thing?" She spoke low, she did not
want the rest to hear.</p>

<p>Babba spread his hands in a deprecating toleration
for his hostess' density.</p>

<p>"She's everywhere with Mead," he said. "Drives
to the theatre with him, you know, walks with him, talks
about him."</p>

<p>"That doesn't explain anything, even if it's true."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>"Doesn't it? When you're being indiscreet, lay emphasis
on your husband. That's the standing rule,
Lady Kilnorton. You'll see; when she gets tired of
Mead, we shall hear no more of Jack Fenning."</p>

<p>Irene looked at him resentfully; he was abominably
confident. And after all Ora was a strange being; in
spite of their friendship, still outside her comprehension
and not reducible to her formulas.</p>

<p>"But she's full of his coming," she expostulated.
"She's&mdash;well, not exactly glad, I suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should suppose not," smiled Babba.</p>

<p>"But quite excited about it. And Mr. Mead knows
he's coming too."</p>

<p>"No doubt Mead says he knows he's coming."
Babba had once served his articles to a solicitor, and
reminiscences of the rules of evidence and the value of
testimony hung about him.</p>

<p>"Well, I believe he'll come," Irene declared with external
firmness and an internal faintness.</p>

<p>"He won't, you'll see," returned Babba placidly.</p>

<p>Desiring an end to this vexatious conversation, Irene
cast her eyes round her guests who were engaged in
drinking tea and making talk to one another. Her
glance detached Bowdon from his attendance on Minna
Soames and brought him to her side; Babba, however,
did not move away.</p>

<p>"The whole thing is very likely a despairing effort of
Miss Pinsent's conscience," he said. "How are you,
Lord Bowdon?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Babba, you here? Gossipping as usual, I
see."</p>

<p>"He says Ora's husband won't come."</p>

<p>"Well, he doesn't know anything about it."</p>

<p>"I'll take six to four," said Babba eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>"I don't think I care to bet about it," said Bowdon.</p>

<p>"Ah, I expect not!" For Babba the only possible
reason against making any bet in the world was the
fear of losing it.</p>

<p>"Do go and talk to Minna Soames," Irene implored
him. "She'll be ready enough to disbelieve anything
creditable about poor Ora." Babba smiled knowingly
and began to edge away. Bowdon sat down by his
<i>fiancée</i>. "I do believe it, you know," she said, turning
to him. Babba looked back with a derisive smile.</p>

<p>"Why should she say it, if it's not true?" asked
Irene, addressing Bowdon and pointedly ignoring
Babba.</p>

<p>"Oh, no doubt it's true," said Bowdon. "Why
shouldn't it be true?"</p>

<p>Babba had put forward the constant companionship
of Ora and Ashley Mead at once as evidence that the
report was not true and as the explanation of its being
circulated; Irene was inclined to attribute to it only the
first of these functions.</p>

<p>"She goes on very oddly, if it is," she murmured.
"But then she is odd."</p>

<p>"It's true, depend upon it," said Bowdon.</p>

<p>His solid persistence both comforted and exasperated
her. She desired to think the report true, but she did
not wish him to accept it merely in the unquestioning
loyalty to Ora Pinsent which his tone implied. A thing
was not true simply because Ora chose to say it; men
lose all their common-sense where a woman is concerned;
so say women themselves; so said Irene
Kilnorton.</p>

<p>"What impresses me," she went on, "is that Ashley
Mead told me."</p>

<p>"I suppose he got his information from her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>"Of course; but he can judge." She paused and
added, "It's a very good thing, if it is true."</p>

<p>"Is it?" asked Bowdon. The question was an
almost naked dissent.</p>

<p>Irene looked at him severely.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," she observed, "that men ought to
pretend to approve of respectability. One doesn't ask
them to be respectable."</p>

<p>"The man's a scamp, according to all accounts."</p>

<p>"He's her husband."</p>

<p>"He'll make her miserable, and take her money, and
so on."</p>

<p>"No doubt his arrival will be inconvenient in a good
many ways," Irene allowed herself to remark with significant
emphasis. She had, she declared, no patience
with the way men looked at such things; the man was
the woman's husband after all. She found growing in
her a strong disposition to champion Mr. Fenning's
cause through thick and thin. "We don't know his
version of the case," she reminded Bowdon after a
pause.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's true, of course," he conceded with what
she felt was an empty show of fairness. In reality he
had prejudged the case and condemned the absent and
unheard defendant. That was because he was a man
and Ora Pinsent good-looking; a habit regrettable in
men generally becomes exasperating, almost insulting,
in one's own lover, especially with circumstances of a
peculiar nature existing in the past and still very vivid
in memory.</p>

<p>One way in which the news affected Bowdon he had
allowed Irene to perceive; he was not at his ease as to
how Ora would fare, and there was a touch of jealousy
in his picture of Mr. Fenning's probable conduct. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>
he was conscious also of thankfulness that he had
escaped from the sort of position in which he might
have been placed had he yielded to his impulse, and in
which, so far as he saw, Ashley Mead was now involved.
His dignity would not have suffered him to
enter into any rivalry with Fenning, while to leave the
field clear to Fenning would have been a sacrifice hard
to make. From this evil fortune the woman by him
had rescued him, or enabled him to rescue himself, and
he was full of gratitude to her; while she was still resenting
the jealousy which he had betrayed with regard
to Ora Pinsent, he surprised her by some whispered
words of more tenderness than he commonly used and
by a look which sent new hope through her. Suddenly
she grasped that this event might do what she had not
been able to do, might reconcile him to what was,
gradually wean him wholly from the thought of what
might have been, and in the end render him to her
entirely her own in heart and soul. She would be very
grateful to Jack Fenning if he accomplished that for
her; he would have remade her life.</p>

<p>"You're quite gallant to-day," she whispered with a
blush and a glad sparkle in her eyes. "We were very
nearly quarrelling just now, weren't we?" she asked
with a bright smile.</p>

<p>"We'll never be nearer, my dear," he answered; he
had the most intense desire to please her.</p>

<p>"And about this Fenning man! Imagine!" she
whispered in scornful amusement.</p>

<p>Bowdon went off to the House and the other guests
took their leave. When all had gone Alice Muddock
arrived; the two ladies had arranged to dine and spend
a quiet hour together before they went to the parties
for which they were engaged. When they were left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
alone Alice, with a sigh, told her friend that Queen's
Gate seemed like a refuge.</p>

<p>"We've been so uncomfortable at home the last few
days," she explained. "At least I've found it very uncomfortable.
You know about Ashley and the business?
Well, father's furious with him about it, so's
Bob, so's my stepmother, of course. And then&mdash;"
She paused as though in hesitation.</p>

<p>"Well, and then?" asked Irene Kilnorton.</p>

<p>"Bob's brought home a lot of gossip about him from
the club. Has Mr. Flint been here?" Lady Kilnorton
nodded tragically. "He told Bob something, and
father's furious about that too. So he won't hear
Ashley's name mentioned, and takes his revenge by
having Bertie Jewett always in the house. And I don't
think I much like Bertie Jewett, not every day anyhow."</p>

<p>"I've only just made his acquaintance&mdash;through
your brother."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's just what he would be; it's not his fault,
you know." She began to laugh. "He pays me marked
attentions."</p>

<p>"The Industrious Apprentice!" said Irene with a
nod. "Ashley's the idle one."</p>

<p>"It's all very absurd and very tiresome." She had
risen and walked across the room. From the other end
of it she asked abruptly, "What do they say about him
and Miss Pinsent?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, what don't they say about everybody?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it. I like her; and of course I like
him."</p>

<p>"And I expect they like one another, so it's all
harmonious," said Irene; but she repented the next
moment. "I don't believe anything bad. But he's
very silly about her. It'll all pass." After a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span>
thanks to the new hope in her, she added a courageous
generalisation. "Such nonsense never lasts long," she
said. Then she looked at Alice, and it struck her
suddenly that Alice would have referred to the news
about Jack Fenning, had she known it; it seemed odd
that everybody should not have heard of a subject
so rich in interest.</p>

<p>"You know about Mr. Fenning?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Mr&mdash;? Oh, yes! You mean Miss Pinsent's
husband? I know she has a husband, of course."</p>

<p>Then she did not know the new development.</p>

<p>"I've got a bit of news for you," said Irene luxuriously.
"Guess."</p>

<p>"I won't guess even to please you. I hate guessing."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Fenning's coming home. I'll tell you all
about it."</p>

<p>Beyond the bare fact there was in reality very little
to tell, but the fact was capable of being clothed with so
much meaning, of being invested with so many attendant
possibilities, of taking on such various colours, that it
seemed in itself a budget of news. Alice did justice to
its claims; she was undeniably interested; the two
found themselves talking it over in a vein which prevented
them from pretending to one another that they
were not both excited about it. They felt like allies
who rejoiced together at the coming of a reinforcement.
Irene's satisfaction was open and declared; Alice was
more reticent and inclined to thoughtfulness. But even
as an abstract existence on the other side of the world
Mr. Fenning had comforted her; his virtue as a balm
was endlessly multiplied by the prospect of his arrival
in concrete form and flesh.</p>

<p>"The men amuse me," said Irene loftily. "They're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
all pitying Ora; they don't seem to give a thought to
poor Mr. Fenning."</p>

<p>"Have you seen Ashley since&mdash;since the news
came?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but only for a minute. He mentioned it as
certain, but quite indifferently. Of course he'd pretend
to be indifferent."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Alice. "Perhaps he is really."</p>

<p>"How can he be?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he means to take no notice of Mr. Fenning."</p>

<p>"My dearest Alice!" cried Irene. "You absolutely
shock me. Besides it isn't like that at all. Ora's most
excited about his coming. I can't make them out,
though."</p>

<p>They fell to debating the constant companionship;
the drive to the theatre, improved by Babba Flint's
tongue into an invariable habit, was a puzzle, fitting
very badly with an excited interest in Mr. Fenning's
return. From these unprofitable enquiries they agreed
to retreat to the solid basis of hope which the reappearance
of the husband gave; on that they congratulated
one another.</p>

<p>Common danger breeds candour; common good
fortune breeds candour; finally, a <i>tête-à-tête</i> dinner breeds
candour. By the time they reached the sweets Irene
Kilnorton, in the course of a demonstration that Ashley
must and would get over his infatuation, that such
nonsense never lasted, and that Mr. Fenning's return
would put a summary end to anything of the sort, had
confided to her friend that just for a little while Lord
Bowdon had shewn signs of an inclination to hover
round the same perilous flame. She was able to reveal
the secret now, because she was so full of hope that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
was all a thing of the past; she found her confidence
itself strengthened by a bold assertion of it.</p>

<p>"Frank's got over it pretty quickly, anyhow," she
ended with a secure laugh.</p>

<p>Alice was not so expansive, she had not victory to
justify her; she said nothing in words, but when Irene
accompanied her "It'll all come right, dear, you'll
see," with a squeeze of the hand, she blushed and smiled,
returned the squeeze, and kissed her friend on the first
convenient opportunity. For all practical purposes the
confession was complete, and the alliance sealed anew,&mdash;with
the addition of a third, involuntary, and unconscious
member in the person of Mr. Jack Fenning of
Bridgeport, Connecticut.</p>

<p>At Alice's party Ashley Mead appeared. Lady
Muddock made timid efforts to avoid him and ludicrously
timid attempts to snub him. He laughed at both, and
insisted on talking to her with great cordiality for ten
minutes before he carried Alice off to supper. Her he
treated with even more than his usual friendly intimacy;
he surprised her by displaying very high spirits. All
went well with him, it seemed; he had been paid fine
compliments on his work as secretary to the Commission;
his acceptance of the post promised to help
rather than hinder him at the Bar; he had received a
suggestion that he should try his hand at a couple of
articles a week for an important journal.</p>

<p>"It's all quite wrong, of course," he said, laughing.
"After refusing Buckingham Palace Road, I ought to
be reduced to starvation and have to crawl back like the
Prodigal Son. But the course of events is terribly unregenerate;
it's always missing the moral. The world
isn't very moral, left to itself."</p>

<p>Alice loved him in this mood of gaiety; her own serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
and sober disposition found relief in it. But she
liked it more as a flower of talk than as a living rule of
action.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," she said, with full sincerity. "Of
course I knew that your getting on was only a matter of
time."</p>

<p>"I really believe," he said, "that I've at last just got
the knife between the outside edges of the oyster shell.
I hope it's a good oyster inside, though!"</p>

<p>"It's sure to be a good one for you," was her answer.
She could not help giving him that sort of answer; if it
betrayed her, she must bear the betrayal. She gave him
the answer even now, when he was under the ban of
heavy disapproval on account of Ora Pinsent. But she
wondered to find him so gay, in a state of such contentment
with the world, and of such interest in it. Bearing
in mind what she now knew, she would not have marvelled
to find him in deepest depression or even in a
hardly controlled despair. He looked down in her face
with a merry laugh and some trifling joke which was
only an excuse for it; his eyes dwelt on her face, apparently
in a frank enjoyment of what he found there. But
what could he, who looked daily on the face of Ora
Pinsent, find there? His pleasure was absurd, she told
herself, but it won upon her; at least she was not boring
him; for the moment anyhow he was not wishing
himself somewhere else. Here was a transient triumph
over the lady with whom the gossips linked his name;
to Alice's modesty it was much to make forgotten in
absence one in whose presence she herself must have
been at once forgotten.</p>

<p>He began to flirt with her; he had done the same
thing before, now and then, by way of a change she supposed,
perhaps lest their friendship should sink too far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
into the brotherly-sisterly state. She desired this state
less than he, but his deviations from it brought her pleasure
alloyed with pain. Indeed she could not, as she
admitted, quite understand flirtation; had it been all
pretence she could have judged and would have condemned,
but a thing so largely made up of pretence, and
yet redeemed from mere pretence by a genuineness of
the moment's mood, puzzled her. Fretfully aware of a
serious bent in herself, of a temper perilously near to a
dull literalness, she always tried to answer in kind when
he, or indeed anybody else, offered to engage in the
game with her. When it was Ashley she used to abandon
herself, so far as her nature allowed her, to the
present pleasure, but never got rid of the twofold feeling
that he did not mean what he said and that he ought to
mean more than he said. That he should flirt with her now
was especially strange. She did not do him the injustice
of supposing that he was employing her merely in order
to throw the critics of his relations with Ora off the scent.
She came nearer to the truth in concluding that the
flirtation, like the rest of his bearing, was merely an outcome
of general good-humour. The puzzle was postponed
only one stage; how could he be in good-humour,
how did he contrive to rejoice in his life and exult in it?
He was in love with Ora Pinsent; such a love was hopeless
if not disastrous, disastrous if not hopeless; in any
aspect that she could perceive it was irremediably tragic.
But Ashley Mead was radiant.</p>

<p>The idea which Irene Kilnorton said absolutely shocked
her recurred as a possible explanation; did he mean to
take no notice of Mr. Fenning? An alarmed horror
filled her; her love and her moral code joined in an
urgent protest. Such a thing would mean degradation
for him, it might mean ruin or something like it for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
career; besides that, it must mean an end of him so far
as she was concerned; it would set an impenetrable insurmountable
barrier between them. But how did men
approach a determination like that? Surely through
sorrow, gloom, and despair? Ah, but there was sometimes
a mad desperate gaiety that went with and covered
such a resolve. She looked at him with a sudden distress
that showed itself in her eyes and parted lips. The
change in her caught his notice, but she was too engrossed
with her fear to feel embarrassment or false
shame. He broke off what he was saying to ask, "Why,
what's the matter, Alice? Have you seen a ghost
drinking champagne?"</p>

<p>"They say you're being very foolish," she answered
in a low steady voice, not moving her eyes from his face.
"Oh, Ashley, you're not going to&mdash;to do anything mad?"</p>

<p>A pause followed; presently he looked at her and
said, with seeming surprise,</p>

<p>"Have you been thinking of that all the time?"</p>

<p>"No, only just now."</p>

<p>"Why? I mean, what made you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I've heard things. And you were so&mdash;I can't say
what I mean! When people are very gay and in great
spirits, and so on, don't the Scotch say they're fey, and
that something will happen to them?"</p>

<p>"Most nations have said so," he answered lightly; but
a slight frown came on his brow, as he added, "So I'm
fey, am I?" His laugh was a little bitter.</p>

<p>"I've no right to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Every right." Whatever was in his face, there was
neither offence nor resentment. "Only it's not worth
your while to bother," he went on.</p>

<p>"You know I think it is," she answered with simple
directness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>He looked at her wistfully; for a moment there came
to him such a mood as had arrested Bowdon's steps and
availed to turn his feet into a new path. But Ashley's
temper was not the same. He did not say that because
this path was the best it should be his, be the other ever
so attractive; he admitted with a sigh that the other was
more attractive, nay, was irresistible, and held on his way
straight to it.</p>

<p>"You're one of the best people in the world, Alice,"
he said. And he added, smiling, "Don't believe all you
hear. Everybody is behaving very properly."</p>

<p>"That's not the Kensington Palace Gardens' opinion."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm damned for ever in Sir James' eyes.
Bertie Jewett reigns in my stead."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it exactly," she agreed.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders petulantly. "So be it,"
said he, with contemptuous resignation. "Oh, I don't
mean that I think you look at it like that," he added an
instant later.</p>

<p>She wanted to speak to him about what Irene Kilnorton
had told her; her desire was to hear from his
own lips that he did not mean to take no notice of Mr.
Fenning. The subject was difficult of approach, embarrassed
by conventionalities and forbidden by her consciousness
of a personal interest. Before she could find
any way of attacking it indirectly, Ashley began to talk
again fluently and merrily, and this mood lasted until she
parted from him; she had no further chance of getting
inside his guard, and went home, wondering still at his
high spirits. On the whole she had drawn comfort from
the evening. She decided to reject that far-fetched idea
which called him fey because he was merry, and to repose
on two solid facts: the first being that Ashley did not
seem heart-broken, the second that Mr. Fenning was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
coming back to his wife. Among any people whom she
could measure or understand, these two facts would have
been of high importance, enough in themselves to determine
the issue. But she felt about Ashley something
of the same ignorance which paralysed all her efforts to
understand Ora Pinsent or to forecast the actions of that
gifted but bewildering lady. Certainly she would have
been no more in her intellectual depth had she understood
that the doings which were setting Babba Flint's
tongue and all the other tongues a-wagging were simply
a natural outcome and almost an integral part of a great
scheme of renunciation.</p>

<p>She could not be blamed. Ashley Mead himself was
hardly less at a loss on the occasions when he allowed
himself to take thought concerning the matter. But
they were few; he could despair of the situation, and
this he did often when he was alone; he could accept
it, as he came to do when with Ora; he could abandon
himself to the gaiety of the moment, as in the mood in
which Alice had found him. But he could not think out
the course of events. He had now only one clear purpose,
to make things as easy as he could to Ora, to obey
her commands, to fall in with her idea, to say nothing
which would disturb the artificial tranquillity which she
seemed to have achieved. The letter had started on its
way to Jack Fenning, the renunciation was set on foot.
The few days, the week or two, that still remained to
them seemed to make little difference. To scandal he
had become indifferent, the arrival was to confute it; of
pain he had become reckless since it was everywhere
and in every course; the opinions of his friends he
gathered merely as a source of bitter amusement; the
good fortune on which he had allowed himself to descant
to Alice Muddock had a very ironical flavour about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
since it chose to come at the time when it could afford
him no real gratification, when he was engrossed with
another interest, when he had room only for one sorrow
and only for one triumph.</p>

<p>At supper at one of his clubs that night he chanced
to find Mr. Sidney Hazlewood, who was a member.
Ashley sat down beside him at the table, exchanging
a careless nod. Mr. Hazlewood ate his supper with
steady silent persistence; Ashley made rather poor
work of a kidney; he had not really wanted supper, but
preferred it to going home to bed.</p>

<p>"You're not conversational," he observed at last to
Hazlewood.</p>

<p>"Afraid of interrupting your reverie," Hazlewood
explained with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have sat down by you unless I'd wanted
to talk. How's the piece going?"</p>

<p>"First-rate. Thought you'd have known; you're
about pretty often."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I generally omit to enquire at the box
office," said Ashley with an air of apology.</p>

<p>Mr. Hazlewood pushed back his chair and threw
down his napkin. Then he lit a cigar with great care
and took several whiffs. At last he spoke.</p>

<p>"Mind you, Mead," said he with a cautious air, "I
don't say it's wrong of a man at your time of life to be
a fool, and I don't say I haven't been just as great a fool
myself, and I don't say that you haven't a better excuse
for it than I ever had, and I don't say that half the men
in town wouldn't be just as great fools as you if they
had the chance."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're not going to say any of those
absurd things," remarked Ashley with gravity.</p>

<p>"But all I say is that you are a fool."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>"Is that quite all?" asked Ashley.</p>

<p>Hazlewood's smile broadened a little.</p>

<p>"Not quite," said he. "I left out one word. An
epithet."</p>

<p>Ashley surveyed him with a kindly and good-tempered
smile.</p>

<p>"Well, old chap, I don't see how you could say anything
else," he observed.</p>

<p>It was merely one, no doubt a typical one, of the
opinions that had for the present to be disregarded. In
due time the renunciation would confound them all. Of
this Mr. Hazlewood and his like foresaw nothing; had
it been shewn to them in a vision they would not have
believed; if, <i>per impossibile</i>, they believed&mdash;Ashley's
lips set tight and stern as imagination's ears listened to
their cackling laughter. From of old virtue in man is
by men praised with a sneer.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a><span>CHAPTER XI</span>
<span class="smaller">WHAT IS TRUTH?</span></h2>


<p>There was one aspect of the renunciation on
which Ora had the tact not to dwell in conversation
with her faithful ally; it was, however, an added
source of comfort to herself, and proved very useful at
moments when her resolve needed reinforcement. As an
incidental result of its main object, as a kind of byproduct
of beneficence, the renunciation was to make
Alice Muddock happy. Ora had always given a corner
to this idea. To use the metaphor which insisted on
occurring to Ashley, Alice had a part&mdash;not a big part,
but a pretty part; in the last act her faithful love was to
be rewarded. She would not (and could not consistently
with the plan of the whole piece) look to receive
a passionate attachment, but a reasonable and sober
affection, such as her modest wisdom must incline her
to accept, would in the end be hers; from it was to
spring, not rapturous joy, but a temperate happiness,
and a permanent union with Ashley Mead. Ashley
was to be led to regard this as the best solution, to fall
in with it at first in a kind of resignation, and later on
to come to see that it had been the best thing under the
circumstances of the case. Ora could bring him to
perceive this (though perhaps nobody else could); to
her Alice would owe the temperate happiness, and
Ashley a settlement in life from all points of view most
advantageous. Ora herself continued to have a good
deal to do with this hypothetical wedded life; she pictured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
herself making appearances in it from time to
time, assuaging difficulties, removing misunderstandings,
perhaps renewing to Ashley her proof of its desirability,
and shewing him once again that, sweet as
her life with him and his with her must have proved,
yet the renunciation had been and remained true wisdom,
as well as the only right course. These postnuptial
scenes with Ashley were very attractive to Ora in
her moods of gentle melancholy. The picture of the
married life in the considerable intervals during which
she made no appearance in it, but was somewhere with
Mr. Fenning, was left vague and undefined.</p>

<p>Ora caught at a visit from Lord Bowdon as the first
fruit of the renunciation and a promise of all that was
to follow after. He had not come near her since the
day when she dismissed him with her "Don't;" within
a week from the announcement of Mr. Fenning's approaching
return he paid a call on her. The inference
was easy, and to a large extent it was correct. Ora
could not resist drawing her visitor and Irene Kilnorton
into the play; quite small parts were theirs, but they
furnished the stage and heightened the general impression.
Their married life also was to be tinged and
coloured by the past; they also were to owe something
to the renunciation; it had restored to them complete
tranquillity, removed from him a wayward impulse,
from her a jealous pang, and set them both on the
straight path of unclouded happiness. She could not
say any of this to Bowdon, but she hinted it to Ashley,
who laughed, and when Bowdon came she hinted to
him her hopes concerning Alice Muddock. He laughed
like Ashley, but with a very doubtful expression in his
eyes. By now the world was talking rather loudly
about Miss Pinsent and Mr. Ashley Mead. Bowdon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
was inclined to think that his hostess was "humbugging"
him in a somewhat transparent fashion. He did
not resent it; he found, with an appreciable recrudescence
of alarm, that he minded very little what she
talked about so that she sat there and talked to him.
His inward "Thank God, the fellow's coming!" was a
triumphant vindication of part, at least, of Ora's faith
in the renunciation. He pulled his moustache thoughtfully
as he observed,</p>

<p>"I suppose a match between Miss Muddock and
Ashley was always an idea. Irene says old Sir James
has been set on it for years."</p>

<p>Sir James made a quiet and unobtrusive entry on the
stage, bringing (by a legitimate stretch of fancy) his
sympathetic wife with him; even Ora could not make
anything of Bob for scenic purposes.</p>

<p>"But Ashley's not a fellow to be forced into what he
doesn't care about."</p>

<p>"Not forced, no," murmured Ora. The method was
not so crude as that.</p>

<p>"And we've no right to take the lady's feelings for
granted."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Ora earnestly.</p>

<p>"There are certainly no signs of anything of the sort
at present."</p>

<p>"At present! No!" she cried almost indignantly.
Then she detected a hint of amusement in Bowdon's
eye and began to laugh. In spite of all the sorrow and
pain involved in the renunciation, its spice of secrecy
and mystification sometimes extorted a smile from her;
people were so hopelessly puzzled about it, so very far
from guessing the truth, and so wide of the mark in
their conjectures. Bowdon evidently shared the general
bewilderment and felt a difficulty in talking to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
about Ashley Mead. She presented him with another
topic.</p>

<p>"The news about you and Irene made me so happy,"
she said. "Irene's such a dear."</p>

<p>"You're very kind," he muttered. This topic was
not much less awkward than the other, and Ora's enthusiasm
had imparted to her manner the intense cordiality
and sympathy which made Irene say that she
conveyed the idea of expecting to be kissed; he preferred
that she should not suggest that idea to him.</p>

<p>"It's such a lovely arrangement in every way," she
pursued. "Isn't it?" Her eyes were raised to his;
she had meant to be quite serious, but her look betrayed
the sense of fun with which she offered her congratulations.
She could not behave quite as though
nothing had ever passed between them; she was willing
to minimise but declined to annihilate a certain memory
common to them. "I'm going to come and see you
very often when you're married," she went on. Bowdon
was willing enough to meet her subtly hinted
mockery.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll be very discreet," he said with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be discreet. There isn't much to be discreet
about, is there?"</p>

<p>"That's not my fault," he allowed himself to remark
as he rose to take leave.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're not going yet?" she cried. "If you do
I shall think it was simply a duty call. And it's so
long since I've seen you." Her innate desire&mdash;it was
almost an instinct&mdash;to have every man leave her with
as much difficulty as possible imparted a pathetic earnestness
to her tone. "Perhaps I shan't have many
more chances of seeing you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>"Many&mdash;after I'm married," he reminded her,
smiling.</p>

<p>"No, I'm serious now," she declared. "You&mdash;you
know what's going to happen, Lord Bowdon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"Of course when Jack comes home I shan't be so
free. Besides&mdash;!" She did not end the sentence; the
suppressed words would obviously have raised the
question of Jack Fenning's acceptability to her friends.
For his part Bowdon immediately became certain that
Jack was a ruffian. He held out his hand, ostensibly
in farewell; Ora took it and pressed it hard, her eyes
the while demanding much sympathy. Bowdon found
himself giving her intense sympathy; he had not before
realised what this thing meant to her, he had been too
much occupied with what it meant to him. He could
not openly condole with her on her husband's return,
but he came very near that point in his good-bye.</p>

<p>"Your friends will always want to see you, and&mdash;and
be eager to do anything in the world they can for
you," he said. The pressure of her hand thanked him,
and then he departed. As he walked out of the hall-door,
he put his hat very firmly on his head and drew a
long breath. He was conscious of having escaped a
danger; and he could not deny, in spite of poor Ora's
hard fortune, that the return of Mr. Fenning was a
good thing.</p>

<p>Good or bad, the coming was near now. The brief
and business-like letter had reached Bridgeport, Connecticut,
and had elicited a reply by cable. In eight
days Mr. Fenning might be expected at Southampton.
As the event approached, it seemed to become less
and less real to Ashley; he found himself wondering
whether a man who is to be hanged on Monday has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
more than the barest intellectual belief in the fact,
whether it really sinks into his consciousness until the
rope is absolutely round his neck. Accidents by sea
and land suggested themselves to an irresponsible and
non-indictable fancy; or Jack had merely meant to
extort a gift of money; or his unstable purpose would
change. The world that held himself and Ora seemed
incapable of opening to receive Jack Fenning; something
would happen. Nothing did happen except that
the last days went on accomplishing themselves in their
unmoved way, and when Ashley went to bed each night
Jack Fenning was twenty-four hours nearer. Ora's conduct
increased the sense of unreality. She wanted him
always with her; she dissipated his scruples with radiant
raillery or drowned them in threatened tears. On the
other hand, she was full of Jack Fenning now; often
talking about him, oftener still about how she would
receive him. She sketched his career for Ashley's information;
the son of a poor clergyman, he had obtained
a berth in a shipowner's office at Hamburg; he had lost
it and come home; he had made the acquaintance of
a Jewish gentleman and been his clerk on the Stock
Exchange; he had written a play and induced the
Jewish gentleman to furnish money for its production;
disaster followed; Jack became an auctioneer's clerk;
the Jewish gentleman, with commendable forgivingness,
had put him in the way of a successful gold mine (that
is, a successfully floated gold mine); he had made two
thousand pounds. "Then he married me," Ora interpolated
into her summary narrative. The money was
soon spent. Then came darker times, debts, queer expedients
for avoiding, and queerer for contriving, payment,
and at last a conviction that the air of America
would suit him better for a time. The picture of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span>
worthless, weak, idle, plausible rascal emerged tolerably
complete from these scattered touches. One thing she
added, new to her hearer and in a way unwelcome:
Jack was&mdash;had been, she put it, still treating him as
belonging to the past&mdash;extremely handsome. "Handsomer
than you, much," she said, laughing, with her face
very near his over his shoulder as he sat moodily by
the window. He did not look round at her, until, by
accident as it seemed and just possibly was, a curl of
her dark hair touched his cheek; then he forgave her
the handsomeness of Jack Fenning.</p>

<p>Irene Kilnorton had been with her that day and had
told her that, since she chose to have the man back, she
must treat him properly and look as though she were
glad to see him; that she must, in fact, give a fair trial
to the experiment which she had decided to allow.
Being thoroughly in harmony with the theory of renunciation,
this advice made a great impression on Ora.
She professed her joy that Jack was to arrive on a
Sunday, because she would thus be free from the theatre
and able to meet him at Southampton. To meet
him at Southampton was an admirable way of treating
him properly and of giving a fair trial to the experiment.
Ashley's raised brows hinted that this excess of
welcome was hardly due to the Prodigal. Ora insisted
on it. He was past surprise by now, or he would have
wondered when she went on:</p>

<p>"But of course I can't go alone; I hate travelling
alone; and I don't know anything about how the boats
come in or anything. You must come with me, you
know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm to go with you, am I?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and you'll go and find him and bring him to
me. Somebody'll tell you which is him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>"And then I'm to leave you with him and come back
to town alone?"</p>

<p>Ora's smile suddenly vanished. "Don't, dear," she
said, laying her hand on his arm. That was her way
always when he touched on the black side of the situation.
Her plans and pictures still stopped short with
the arrival of the boat. "It'll be our last time quite
alone and uninterrupted together," she reminded him,
as though he could forget the object of the expedition
and be happy in the thought that it meant two hours
with her.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you shouldn't travel back with us,"
she added a moment later. "Oh, of course you will!"</p>

<p>He chafed at her use of the word "us," for now it
meant herself and Jack, and had the true matrimonial
ring, asserting for Mr. Fenning a position which the law
only, and not Ashley's habit of thought, accorded him.
But he would have to accustom himself to this "us" and
all that it conveyed. He forced himself to smile as he
observed, "Perhaps Fenning'll want to smoke!"</p>

<p>Ora laughed merrily and said that she hoped he
would. Even to Ashley it seemed odd that the notion
appeared to her rather as a happy possibility than as a
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of her attitude; she really thought
it conceivable that Jack might go and smoke, while she
and Ashley had another "last time quite alone together."
But she had such an extraordinary power of commending
absurdities to serious consideration that he caught
himself rehearsing the best terms in which to make the
suggestion to Mr. Fenning.</p>

<p>In those days he had it always in mind to tell her a
thing on which he was resolutely determined, which
even she could not make him falter about. With the
entry of Jack Fenning must come his own exit. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
did not deceive himself as to his grounds for this resolve,
or deck in any gorgeous colours of high principle what
was at best no more than a dictate of self-respect and
more probably in the main an instinct of pride. But
from the hour of the arrival of the boat he meant to be
no more an intimate friend of hers. Had his business
engagements allowed he would have arranged to leave
London. Absence from town was impossible to him
without a loss which he could not encounter, but London
is a large place, where people need not be met unless
they are sought. He would deliver her over to her
husband and go his way. But he did not tell her; she
would either be very woeful, and that calamity he could
not face, or she would give a thoughtless assent and go
on making her pictures just the same. The resolution
abode in his own heart as the one fixed point, as the
one definite end to all this strange period of provisional
indiscretion and unreal imaginings. When he thought
of it, he rose to the wish that Jack might be still handsome
and might prove more reputable and kinder than
he had been in the old days. Ora herself was beginning
to have hopes of Jack, or hopes of what she might make
of him by her zealous care and dutiful fidelity; Ashley
encouraged these hopes and they throve under his
watering. In the course of the last week there was
added to the great idea of a renunciation of Ashley the
hardly less seductive and fascinating project of a reformation
of Jack Fenning. This conception broadened
and enriched the plot of the fanciful drama, added a
fine scene or two, and supplied a new motive for the
heroine. In the end Ora had great hopes of Jack in
the future and a very much more charitable opinion of
him in the past.</p>

<p>She paid her promised visit to Alice Muddock on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
Wednesday, Jack Fenning being due on the following
Sunday. In these last days Ora devoted herself entirely
to people who were, in some way or other, within the
four corners of the scheme of renunciation. Alice was
amazed to find in her a feeling about her husband's
arrival hardly distinguishable from pleasure; at least
she was sure that a cable message that he was not coming
would have inflicted a serious disappointment on
her visitor. But at the same time this strange creature
was obviously, openly&mdash;a few weeks ago Alice would not
have hesitated to say shamelessly&mdash;in love with Ashley
Mead. The two men's names alternated on her lips; it
seemed moral polyandry or little better. Alice's formulas
were indeed at fault. And through it all ran the
implied assertion that Alice was interested in the affair
for a stronger reason than the friendship which she was
so good as to offer to Ora. Here again, according to
Ora's method, Irene Kilnorton's share in the scheme
was hinted at, while Alice was left to infer her own. She
did so readily enough, having drawn the inference on
her own account beforehand, but her wonder at finding
it in Ora's mind was not diminished. To be passionately
in love with a man and to give him up was conceivable;
any heights of self-sacrifice were within the
purview of Alice's mind. To find a luxury in giving
him up was beyond her. To return to a husband from
a sense of duty would have been to Alice almost a
matter of course, however bad the man might be; to
set to work to make out that the man was not bad
clashed directly with the honest perspicacity of her
intellect. And, to crown all, in the interval, as a preparation
for resuming the path of duty, to set all the
town talking scandal and greet the scandal with a defiance
terribly near to enjoyment! Alice, utterly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span>
fault, grew impatient; her hard-won toleration was hard
tried.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you understand all I feel," said Ora, taking
her friend's hand between hers.</p>

<p>"Indeed I don't," replied Alice bluntly.</p>

<p>"Anyhow you're sorry for me?" Ora pleaded. Here
Alice could give the desired assurance. Ora was content;
sympathy was what she wanted; whether it came
from brain or heart was of small moment.</p>

<p>By a coincidence, which at first sight looked perverse,
Bob brought Babba Flint into Alice's room at tea-time.
Alice did not like Babba, and feared that his coming
would interrupt the revelation of herself which Ora in
innocent unconsciousness was employed in giving. The
result proved quite different. Babba had declared to
Irene Kilnorton that the coming of Mr. Fenning was a
figment concocted from caprice or perhaps with an indirect
motive; he advanced the same view to Ora herself
with unabashed impudence, yet with a seriousness which
forbade the opinion that he merely jested.</p>

<p>"Of course I can't tell whether you expect him, Miss
Pinsent. All I know is he won't come." Babba's eye-glass
fell from his eye in its most conclusive manner.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he will," cried Ora triumphantly. "I know
all about it; the boat, and the time, and everything else."</p>

<p>"You'll see, he won't be there," Babba persisted. "I
wonder if you'll be awfully surprised!"</p>

<p>"Why should I say he's coming if he isn't?" asked
Ora, but rather with amusement than indignation.</p>

<p>"Oh, for an advertisement, or just because it came
into your head, or as the homage liberty pays to matrimony;
any reason you like, you know."</p>

<p>Their debate filled Alice with wonder. It was strange
that Ora should lend an ear to Babba's suggestions, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
she should not at once silence him; yet she listened with
apparent interest, although, of course, she repudiated
the motives imputed to her and declared that in all
sincerity she expected her husband. Babba fell back
on blank assertion. "He won't come, you'll see," he
repeated.</p>

<p>The extreme impertinence of the little man moved
Alice to resentment; in whatever sense his remarks were
taken, they must bear an offensive meaning. But Ora
did not seem resentful; strangely enough she began to
shew signs of disturbance, she brought forward serious
arguments to prove that Jack Fenning would come, and
appealed to Babba to alter his opinion with pathetic
eyes. Babba was inexorable.</p>

<p>"Really you must allow Miss Pinsent to know," Alice
expostulated.</p>

<p>"It's a matter of experience," Babba observed.
"They're always going to turn up, but they never do."</p>

<p>"Why do you say he won't come?" asked Ora
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I've told you the reason. They never do," repeated
Babba obstinately. Bob Muddock burst into a laugh,
Alice frowned severely, Ora's brows were knit in puzzled
wrinkles. This suggestion of an impediment in the way
of the renunciation and reformation was quite new to her;
but she did not appear to be struck at all by what seemed
to Alice the indecency of discussing it.</p>

<p>"Suppose he didn't!" Ora murmured audibly; a smile
came slowly to her lips and her eyes seemed to grow full
of half-imaged possibilities. Babba made no comment;
his smile was enough for all who knew the facts of the
present situation; for example, for all who knew in what
company Miss Pinsent drove to the theatre. "If he
didn't&mdash;" Ora began. Babba's mocking eye was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>
her. She began to laugh. "I know what you're thinking!"
she cried with a menacing wave of her hand.</p>

<p>The scene had become distasteful, almost unendurable,
to Alice Muddock. Here was the side of Ora that she
detested; it raised all the old prejudices in her and
argued that they were well justified. She also knew
what Babba Flint's look meant, and wanted to turn
him out of the room for it. Such punishment would
be only proper; it would also have propitiated in some
degree the jealousy which made her unwilling to admit
that possibly Mr. Fenning might not come.</p>

<p>The young men went; she and Ora were alone together;
Alice's feeling of hostility persisted and became
manifest to Ora's quick perception. In an instant she
implored pity and forgiveness by abandoning herself to
condemnation.</p>

<p>"Now you see what I am! And you might have
been my friend!" she murmured. "But you don't
know how unhappy I am."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you're unhappy at all," said Alice
with blunt barbarity.</p>

<p>"Not unhappy!" exclaimed Ora in dismay. If she
were not unhappy, the whole structure tumbled.</p>

<p>"You will be, though," Alice pursued relentlessly.
"You'll be very unhappy when Mr. Fenning comes,
and I think you'd be unhappy if by any chance he
didn't come." She paused and looked at her visitor.
"I shouldn't like to be like you," she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Ora sat quiet; there was a scared look on her face;
she turned her eyes up to Alice who sat on a higher
chair.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that sort of thing to me?" she
asked in a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>"It's quite true. I shouldn't. And all the rest is
true too." Her voice grew harder and harder in opposition
to an inner pleading for mercy. This woman
should not wheedle her into lies; she would tell the
truth for once, although Ora did sit there&mdash;looking
like a child condemned to rigorous punishment.</p>

<p>"It's not decent the way you talk about it, and let
people talk about it," she broke out in a burst of
indignation. "Have you no self-respect? Don't you
know how people talk about you? Oh, I wouldn't be
famous at the price of that!"</p>

<p>Ora did not cry; the hurt was beyond tears; she
grew white, her eyes were wide and her lips parted;
she watched Alice as a dog seems to watch for the
next fall of the whip.</p>

<p>"You say you're unhappy. Lots of us are unhappy,
but we don't tell all the world about it. And we don't
hug our unhappiness either and make a play out of it."
What Ashley had reluctantly and secretly thought came
in stern and cutting plainness from Alice's lips; but
Ashley would have died sooner than breathe a word
of it to Ora.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Alice, "you think I'm angry because&mdash;because
of something that concerns myself. I'm
not, I'm just telling you the truth." She was sure that
it was the truth, however it might be inspired, however
it was that she had come to utter it. "What does that
man say about you when you aren't there? He says
almost everything to your face! And you laugh! What
does he say after dinner, what does he say at his club?"</p>

<p>"Please let me go home," said Ora. "Please let me
go home." She seemed almost to stagger as she rose.
"I must go home," she said, "Or&mdash;or I shan't have
time for dinner."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>"I suppose you like&mdash;" Alice began, but she stopped
herself. She had said enough; the face before her
seemed older, thinner, drawn into lines that impaired
its beauty, as it were scarred with a new knowledge;
the eyes that met hers were terrified. "It's all true,"
she said to herself again. "Quite true. Only nobody
has ever told her the truth."</p>

<p>She rang the bell, but did not go with Ora to the
door; neither of them thought of shaking hands; a
quarter of an hour before Ora would have offered one
of her ready kisses. Now she went quietly and silently
to the door and opened it with timid noiselessness. As
she went out, she looked back over her shoulder; a
movement from Alice, the holding out of a hand, would
have brought her back in a flood of tears and a burst of
pitiful protests at once against herself and against the
accusations laid to her charge. No sign came; Alice
stood stern and immovable.</p>

<p>"I'm late as it is. Good-bye," whispered Ora.</p>

<p>She went out. Alice stood still where she was for a
moment before she flung herself into a chair, exclaiming
again, and this time aloud,</p>

<p>"It's true, it's true; every word of it's the truth!"
She was very anxious to convince herself that every
word of it was true.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a><span>CHAPTER XII</span>
<span class="smaller">AT CLOSE QUARTERS</span></h2>


<p>The next few days were critical for the renunciation,
and consequently for the reformation which was
to accompany it. In the first place, Jack Fenning was now
very near; secondly, Ashley Mead's behaviour was so
perfect as to suggest almost irresistibly an alternative
course; finally, thanks to Alice Muddock's outspokenness,
Ora was inclined to call virtue thankless and to
decide that one whom all the world held wicked might
just as well for all the world be wicked. She had appealed
from Alice to Irene Kilnorton, hinting at the
cruelty to which she had been subjected. She found
no comfort; there was an ominous tightening of Irene's
lips. Ora flew home and threw herself&mdash;the metaphorical
just avoids passing into the literal&mdash;on Ashley's
bosom. There were tears and protests against
universal injustice; she cried to him, "Take me away
from all of them!" What answer did she expect or
desire? He could not tell. Mr. Fenning was due on
Sunday, and Ora's piece was running still. Yet at the
moment it seemed as though she would fly into space
with him and a hand-bag, leaving renunciations, reformations,
virtues, careers, and livelihoods to look after
themselves, surrendering herself to the rare sweetness
of unhindered impulse. For himself, he was ready;
he had come to that state of mind in regard to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
His ordinary outlook on life was blocked by her image,
his plan of existence, with all its lines of reason, of
hope, of ambition, blurred by the touch of her finger.
Only very far behind, somewhere remote in the background,
lay the haunting conviction that these last, and
not his present madness, would prove in the end the
abiding reality. What made him refuse, or rather evade,
the embracing of her request was that same helplessness
in her which had restrained his kisses in the inn parlour.
If she turned on him later, crying, "You could do what
you liked with me, why did you do this with me?"
what would he have to answer? "We'll settle it to-morrow;
you must start for the theatre now," he said.
"So I must. Am I awfully late?" cried Ora.</p>

<p>That evening he dined with Bob Muddock. Bertie
Jewett and Babba Flint were his fellow-guests. All
three seemed to regard him with interest&mdash;Bob's, admiring;
Bertie's, scornful; Babba's, amused. Bob envied
the achievement of such a conquest; Bertie despised
the man who wasted time on it; Babba was sympathetic
and hinted confidential surprise that anybody made any
bones about it. But they none of them doubted it; and
of the renunciation none knew or took account. A
course of action which fails to suggest itself to anybody
incurs the suspicion of being mad, or at least wrong-headed
and quixotic. Ashley told himself that his
conduct was all these things, and had no countervailing
grace of virtue. It was no virtue to fear a reproach in
Ora's eyes; it was the merest cowardice; yet that fear
was all that held him back.</p>

<p>After dinner Bob drew him to a sofa apart from their
companions and began to discuss the dramatic profession.
Ashley suffered patiently, but his endurance
changed to amusement when Bob passed to the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span>
art of music, found in it a marked superiority,
and observed that he had been talking over the subject
with Minna Soames.</p>

<p>"I don't see how anybody can object to singing at
concerts," said Bob, with a shake of the head for inconceivable
narrow-mindedness, "not even the governor."</p>

<p>"Sits the wind in that quarter?" asked Ashley,
laughing.</p>

<p>"I've got my eye on her, if that's what you mean,"
answered Bob. "She's ripping, isn't she?"</p>

<p>The vague and violent charms which the epithet
seemed to imply were not Minna's. Ashley replied that
she was undoubtedly pretty and charming. Bob eyed
him with a questioning air; it was as though a man who
had been on a merry-go-round were consulted by one
who thought of venturing on the trip.</p>

<p>"People talk a great deal of rot," Bob reflected. "A
girl isn't degraded, or unsexed, or anything of that sort,
just because she sings for her living."</p>

<p>"Surely not," smiled Ashley.</p>

<p>The prejudices were crying out in pain as Bob's newborn
idea crushed and mangled them.</p>

<p>"But the governor's so against all that sort of thing,"
Bob complained. Then he looked up at his friend.
"That's mostly your fault," he added, with an awkward
laugh.</p>

<p>"My dear Bob, the cases are not parallel."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Soames hasn't got a husband, of
course."</p>

<p>There was no use in being angry, or even in representing
that the remark which had seemed so obvious
to Bob was a considerable liberty.</p>

<p>"Imagine her with a thousand husbands, and still the
cases couldn't be parallel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>"She's not on the stage."</p>

<p>"And if she were, the distinctions run by people, not
by professions," said Ashley.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm thinking of it," Bob announced. And he
added, with a ludicrous air of desiring the suspicion,
while he repudiated the fact, of dishonourable intentions,
"All on the square, of course."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, I should think so!" said Ashley.
The imagination of man could attribute no crooked
dealings or irregular positions to Miss Soames.</p>

<p>"Still, I don't know about the governor," Bob ended,
with a relapse into gloom.</p>

<p>"She'd retire from her work, of course?" Ashley
suggested, smiling.</p>

<p>"If she married me? Oh, of course," said Bob decisively.
"She wouldn't want the money, would she?"
Any other end of a profession had not occurred to him,
and his opinion that active and public avocations were
not "unsexing" to women was limited by the proviso
that such employments must be necessary for bread-and-butter.</p>

<p>An eye for the variety of the human mind may make
almost any society endurable. Here was Bob struggling
with conscious daring against convention, as a prelude
to paying his court to a lady who worshipped the god
whom he persuaded himself to brave; here was Babba
Flint drifting vulgarly, cheerfully, irresponsibly, through
all his life and what money he happened from time to
time to possess; here was Bertie Jewett, his feet set
resolutely on the upward track, scorning diversion, crying
"Excelsior" with exalted fervour as he pictured the
gold he would gather and pocket on the summit of the
hill; here, finally, was Ashley himself, who had once
set out to climb another hill, and now eagerly turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>
his head to listen to a sweet voice that cried to him from
the valley. Such differences may lie behind four precisely
similar and equally spotless white shirt-fronts on
the next sofa any evening that we drop into the club.
Therefore it needs discrimination, and perhaps also some
prepossessions, to assign degrees of merit to the different
ideas of how time in this world had best be passed.</p>

<p>"The fact is," Babba was saying to Bertie Jewett, as
he nodded a knowing head towards Ashley, "he was
getting restive, so she made up this yarn about her
husband." He yawned, as if the matter were plain to
dulness.</p>

<p>"What an ass he is!" mused Bertie. "Don't you
know the chance he had? He might have been where
I am!"</p>

<p>Babba turned a rather supercilious look on his
companion.</p>

<p>"The shop? Must be a damned grind, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Bertie was nettled; he revealed a little of what he had
begun to learn that he ought to conceal.</p>

<p>"I bet you I earn a sovereign quicker than you earn
a shilling," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Daresay you do," murmured Babba, regarding the
end of his cigar. Babba was vulgar, but not with this
sort of vulgarity.</p>

<p>"And more of 'em," pursued Bertie.</p>

<p>"But you have an infernally slow life of it," Babba
assured him. Babba was ignorant of the engrossing
charms that sparkle in the eyes of wealth, forbidding
weariness in its courtship, making all else dull and void
of allurement to its votaries. To each man his own
hunger.</p>

<p>Back to his hunger went Ashley Mead, no less ravenous,
yet seeing his craving in the new light of desires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>
revealed to him, but still alien from him. All his world
seemed now united in crying out to him to mind his
steps, in pointing imploringly or mockingly to the abyss
before his feet, in weeping, wondering, or laughing at
him. That some of the protests were conscious, some
unwitting, made no difference; the feeling of standing
aloof from all the rest gave him a sense of doom, as
though he were set apart for his work, and amidst condemnation,
pity, and ridicule must go through with it.
For to-morrow he thought that she would come with
him, leaving Mr. Fenning desolate, Sidney Hazlewood
groaning over agreements misunderstood as to their
nature, friends heart-broken, and the world agape.</p>

<p>But the next day she would not come, or, rather,
prayed not to be taken.</p>

<p>"You mustn't, you mustn't," she sobbed. "Alice
Muddock had made me angry, oh, and hurt me so. I
was ready to do anything. But don't, Ashley dear,
don't! Do let me be good. That'll be the best way of
answering her, won't it? I couldn't answer her then."</p>

<p>"Alice? What's Alice been saying?" he asked, for
he had not been told the details of that particular case
of cruelty.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you. Oh, it was horrible! Was it true?
Say it wasn't true!"</p>

<p>"You haven't told me what it was," he objected.</p>

<p>"Oh dear me, neither I have!" cried Ora, drawing
back from him; her eyes swam in tears, but her lips
bent in smiles. "How awfully absurd of me!" she
exclaimed, and broke into the low luxurious laughter
that he loved. "Well, it was something bad of me; so
it couldn't be true, could it?"</p>

<p>He pressed her to tell him what it was and she told
him, becoming again sorrowful and wounded as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span>
rehearsed the story; the point of view surprised her so.
To Ashley it was no surprise, nothing more than a
sharp unsparing utterance of the doubts of his own
mind. His quarrel with Alice was that she said it, not
that she thought it; she was bound to think it when he
in all his infatuation could not stifle the thought. Was
he in love then with a bundle of emotions and ready to
give away his life in exchange for a handful of poses?
In self-defence he embraced the conclusion and twisted
it to serve his purpose. What more is anybody, he
asked&mdash;what more than the sheet on which slide after
slide is momentarily shewn?</p>

<p>"But still she was wrong," said Ora. "Oh, I can
forgive her. Of course I forgive her. It's only because
she's fond of you. I know I'm not really like that.
It's not the true me, Ashley."</p>

<p>The idea of the "true me" delighted Ora, and the
"true me" required that Mr. Fenning should be met
punctually on Sunday next. The renunciation raised
its head again.</p>

<p>"The 'true me,' then, is really a very sober and correct
person?" asked Ashley.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, enjoying the paradox she asserted.
Her interest in herself was frank and almost
might be called artistic. "Do you think me strange?"
she asked. "I believe you're laughing at me half the
time."</p>

<p>"And the other half?"</p>

<p>"We weep together, don't we? Poor Ashley!"</p>

<p>On the Saturday he came to see her again in order to
make final arrangements for their expedition of the next
day. There was also a point on which they had never
touched, to which, as he believed, Ora had given no
consideration. Was Mr. Fenning to settle down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>
little house at Chelsea? At present the establishment
was in all its appearance and fittings so exclusively
feminine that it seemed an impossible residence for a
man. Ora was not in the room when Janet ushered
him in; that respectable servant lingered near the door
and, after a moment's apparent hesitation, spoke to
him.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, sir," she said, "but could you tell me
where I can get some good whiskey?"</p>

<p>"Whiskey?" Ashley exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fenning, sir, used to be particular about his
whiskey, and as he's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course, Janet." He thought for a
moment and mentioned the wine merchant with whom
Lord Bowdon dealt. "I think you'll be safe there," he
ended with a nod.</p>

<p>Janet thanked him and went out.</p>

<p>"This really brings it home," said Ashley, dropping
into a chair and laughing weakly to himself. "Tomorrow
night Jack Fenning'll sit here and drink that
whiskey, while I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rose abruptly and walked about the room. His
portrait in the silver frame was still on the little table by
Ora's favourite seat; not even a letter from Bridgeport,
Connecticut, was there to hint of Mr. Fenning. The
demand for a good whiskey seemed the sole forerunner
of the wanderer's return.</p>

<p>"She doesn't know in the least what she's doing,"
Ashley muttered as he flung himself into his seat again.</p>

<p>That afternoon she was in the mood hardest for him
to bear. She was sanguine about her husband; she
recalled the short time they had contrived to be happy
together, dwelt on the amiable points in his character,
ascribed his weaknesses more to circumstances than to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>
nature, and took on her own shoulders a generous share
of blame for the household's shipwreck. All this is to
say that the reformation for the instant took precedence
of the renunciation, and a belief in the possibility, not
perhaps of being happy with Jack, but at least of making
Jack happy, was bedecked in the robes of a virtuous
aspiration. "It would be no use having him back if I
couldn't make him happy, would it?" she asked. She
shewed sometimes this strange forgetfulness of her
friend's feelings.</p>

<p>"I know I've got a photograph of him somewhere,"
she said with a troubled little frown. "I wonder where
it is!" Then a lucky thought brought a smile. "I
expect he'd like to see it on the mantel-piece, wouldn't
he?" she cried, turning to Ashley.</p>

<p>"I should think he'd be very touched. He might
even believe it had been there all the time."</p>

<p>"Don't be sarcastic," said Ora good-humouredly.
"I'll ask Janet where I've put it."</p>

<p>Janet, being summoned and questioned, knew where
Miss Pinsent had put the photograph, or anyhow where
it was to be found. In a few minutes she produced it.</p>

<p>"It is handsome, you see," said Ora, handing it across
to Ashley. She appeared anxious for a favourable
opinion from him.</p>

<p>The face was certainly handsome. The features were
straight, the eyes large, the brow well formed; there
was no great appearance of intellect or resolution, but
the smile was amiable. Ashley handed it back with a
nod of assent, and Ora set it on the mantel-piece. Ashley's
bitterness overflowed.</p>

<p>"Put it in the frame instead of mine," he said, stretching
out his hand to take his own portrait.</p>

<p>In an instant Ora was across to the table and snatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
up the picture. She held it close to her with both
hands and stood fronting him defiantly.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "no. You shan't touch it. Nobody
shall touch it."</p>

<p>He leant back with a smile of despairing amusement.
She put down the portrait and came close to him, looking
at him intently; then she dropped on her knees beside
him and took his hand between hers.</p>

<p>"Fancy you daring to think that!" she said. A look
of terror came into her eyes. "You're not going to be
like that?" she moaned. "I can't go on if you're going
to be like that."</p>

<p>He meant far more than he had hinted in his bitter
speech; this afternoon he had intended to tell her his
resolution; this was his last visit to the little house;
from to-morrow afternoon he would be an acquaintance
to whom she bowed in the streets, whom she met now
and then by chance. He might tell her that now&mdash;now
while she held his hands between hers. And if he told
her that and convinced her of it, she would not go to
meet Jack Fenning. He sat silent as she looked up in
his eyes. His struggle was short; it lacked the dramatic
presentment of Ora's mental conflicts, it had no
heroic poses; but there emerged again clearly from the
fight the old feeling that to use her love and his power
in this fashion would not be playing fair; he must let
her have her chance with her husband.</p>

<p>"I was a brute, Ora," he said. "I'll do just what you
like, dear."</p>

<p>With a bound she was back to merriment and her
sanguine view of favourable possibilities in Mr. Fenning.
She built more and more on these last, growing excited
as she pictured how recent years might, nay must, have
improved him, how the faults of youth might, indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
would, have fallen away, and how the true man should
be revealed. "And if he wants a friend, you'll always
be one to him," she ended. Ashley, surrendering at discretion,
promised to be a friend to Jack Fenning.</p>

<p>The next day found her in the same temper. She
was eager and high-strung, merry and full of laughs,
thoughtfully kind, and again thoughtlessly most cruel.
When he called for her in the morning she was ready,
waiting for him; from her air they might have been
starting again for a day in the country by themselves,
going to sit again in the meadow by the river, going to
dine again in the inn parlour whose window opened on
the sweet old garden. No such reminiscences, so sharp
in pain for him, seemed to rise in her or to mar her
triumph. For triumphant she was; her great purpose
was being carried out; renunciation accomplished, reformation
on the point of beginning. Prosperously the
play had run up to its last great scene; soon must the
wondering applause of friends fall on her ear; soon
would Alice Muddock own that her virtue had been too
cruel, and Babba Flint confess his worldly sagacity at
fault. To herself now she was a heroine, and she rejoiced
in her achievements with the innocent vanity of a
child who displays her accomplishments to friendly eyes.
How much she had suffered, how much forgone, how
much resisted! Now she was to reap her reward.</p>

<p>Their train was late; if the boat had made a good
passage it would be in before them; the passengers who
had friends to meet them would be in waiting. They
might find Jack Fenning on the platform as their engine
steamed into the station. They had talked over this
half way through the journey, and Ora seemed rather
pleased at the prospect; Ashley took advantage of her
happy mood to point out that it would be better for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span>
to leave her alone with Jack; he would get a plate of
cold meat somewhere, and go back to town by himself
later on. She acquiesced reluctantly but without much
resistance. "We can tell you about our journey afterwards,"
she said. Then had come more rosy pictures
of the future. At last they were finished. There was a
few minutes' silence. Ashley looked out of the window
and then at his watch.</p>

<p>"We ought to be there in ten minutes," he said.</p>

<p>Her eyes grew wide; her hands dropped in her lap;
she looked at him.</p>

<p>"In ten minutes, Ashley?" she said in a low voice.
It had come at last, the thing, not pictures, not imaginings
of the thing. "Ten minutes?" she whispered.</p>

<p>He could hardly speak to her. As her unnatural
excitement, so his unnatural calm fell away; he lost
composure and was not master of his voice. He took
her hands and said, "Good-bye, my dear, good-bye.
I'm going to lose you now, Ora."</p>

<p>"Ashley, Ashley!" she cried.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to be unkind, but there must be a
difference."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said in a wondering tone. "There must,
I suppose. But you'll come often?"</p>

<p>He meant never to come.</p>

<p>"Now and then, dear," he said. Then he kissed her;
that he had not meant to do; and she kissed him.</p>

<p>"Ashley," she whispered, "perhaps he won't be kind
to me; perhaps&mdash;oh, I never thought of that! Perhaps
he'll be cruel, or&mdash;or not what I've fancied him.
Ashley, my love, my love, don't leave me altogether!
I can't bear it, indeed I can't. I shall die if you
leave me."</p>

<p>She was terrified now at the thought of the unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
man waiting for her and the loss of the man whom she
knew so well. Her dramatic scenes helped her no
more; her tears and terror now were unrehearsed; she
clung to his hand as though it held life for her.</p>

<p>"Oh, how did I ever think I could do it?" she
moaned. "Are we going slower? Is the train stopping?
Oh, are we there, are we there?"</p>

<p>"We've not begun to go slower yet," he said. In
five minutes they must arrive.</p>

<p>"Stay with me till I see him; you must stay; you
must stay till I've seen what&mdash;what he's going to be
to me. I shall kill myself if you leave me."</p>

<p>"I'll stay till you've found him," Ashley answered in
a hard restrained voice. "Then I must go away."</p>

<p>The train rumbled on; they were among the houses
now; the ships in the harbour could be seen; the
people in the next carriage were moving about, chattering
loudly and merrily. The woman he loved sat with
despairing eyes, clinging to his hand. "It's slower,"
she whispered, with lips just parted. "It's slower now,
isn't it?" The train went slower; he nodded assent.
The girl next door laughed gaily; perhaps she went to
meet her lover. Suddenly the brake creaked, they
stopped, there was something in the way. "How tiresome!"
came loudly and impatiently from next door.
Ora's grasp fixed itself tighter on his hand; she welcomed
the brief reprieve. Her eyes drew him to her;
the last embrace seemed to leave her half animate; she
sank back in her seat with closed eyes. With a groan
and a grumble the wheels began to move again. Ora
gave a little shiver but made no other sign. Ashley let
down the window with a jerk, and turned his face to the
cool air that rushed in. He could not look more at
Ora; he had a thing to do now, the last thing, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
was not good for the doing of it that he should look at
her. She might cry again to him, "Take me away!"
and now he might forget that to obey was not fair play.
Besides, here came the platform, and on the platform he
would find Jack Fenning. There may be passions but
there must not be scenes; he could not tell Jack that
he had decided to take Ora back to town on his own
account. He and she between them had spun a web
of the irrevocable; they had followed virtue, here was
the reward. But where were the trappings which had
so gorgeously ornamented it? Ora's eyes were closed
and she saw them no more.</p>

<p>Slowly they crept into the station; the platform was
full of people and of luggage; it seemed as though the
boat were already in. At last the train came to a stand;
he laid his hand lightly on Ora's.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he said. "Will you wait by the carriage
till I find out where he is?"</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and slowly rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll do what you tell me," she said.</p>

<p>He opened the door and helped her to get out. She
shivered and drew her cloak closer round her. There
was a bench near. He led her to it and told her to sit
there. "I shall know him and I'll bring him to you.
Promise not to move," he said.</p>

<p>Just as he turned to leave her she put out her hand
and laid it on his arm.</p>

<p>"Ashley!" he heard her whisper. He bent down to
catch what she said, but it was a moment before she
went on. It seemed as though words came hard to her
and she would like to tell him all with her eyes. She
raised her other hand and pointed to the arm that rested
on his.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>"Did I ever tell you? I forget what I've told you
and what I haven't."</p>

<p>"What is it? What do you want to tell me?"</p>

<p>"He struck me once; on the arm, just there, with his
fist." She touched her arm above the elbow, near the
shoulder.</p>

<p>She had never told him that; nothing less than this
moment's agony, wherein sympathy must be had at
every cost, could have brought it to her lips. Ashley
pressed her hand and turned away to look for Jack
Fenning.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a><span>CHAPTER XIII</span>
<span class="smaller">THE HEROINE FAILS</span></h2>


<p>The fast train, by which they ought to travel,
left for London in a quarter of an hour; a slow
train would follow twenty minutes later. Ashley procured
this information before undertaking his search;
since the platform was still crowded it seemed possible
that Mr. Fenning would not be found in time for the
fast train. He proved hard to find; yet he might have
been expected to be on the look-out. Ashley sought
him conscientiously and diligently, but before long a
vague hope began to rise in him that the man had not
come after all. What then? He did not answer the
question. It was enough to picture Ora freed from her
fears, restored to the thoughtless joyousness of their
early days together. If by wild chance he had found
the man dead or heard that he was dead, he would have
been glad with a natural heathen exultation. People
die on voyages across the Atlantic sometimes; there is
an average of deaths in mid-ocean; averages must be
maintained; how maintain one with more beneficial
incidental results than by killing Mr. Fenning? Ashley
smiled grimly; his temper did not allow the humour of
any situation to escape him; he felt it even in the midst
of the strongest feelings. His search for Jack Fenning,
while Jack Fenning's wife sat in terror, while he loved
Jack Fenning's wife, had its comic side; he wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
how matters would strike Jack, supposing him to be
alive, and to have come; or, again, if he were dead and
fluttering invisible but open-eyed over the platform.</p>

<p>He saw the girl who had been in the next carriage,
hanging on a young man's arm, radiant and half in
tears; but the young man was not like Jack's photograph.
There were many young men, but none of
them Jack Fenning. He scoured the platform in vain.
A whistle sounded loud, and there were cries of "Take
your seats!" Ashley looked at his watch; that was
the express starting; they would be doomed to crawl
to town. Where the plague was Jack Fenning? This
suspense would be terrible for Ora. How soon could
he be safe in going back and telling her that Jack had
not come? What a light would leap to her face! How
she would murmur, "Ashley!" in her low rich voice!
She seemed able to say anything and everything in the
world to him with that one word, "Ashley!" to help the
eloquence of her eyes.</p>

<p>A rush of people scurrying out of the refreshment-room
and running to catch the express encountered
and buffeted him. Here was a place he had not ransacked;
perhaps Jack Fenning was in the refreshment-room;
a remembrance of Janet's anxiety about a good
whiskey gave colour to the idea. Ashley waited till the
exodus was done and then strolled in; the place was
almost empty; the barmaids were reaching their arms
over the counter to gather up the used glasses or wipe
the marble surface with cloths. But at the far end of
the room there was a man standing at the bar, with a
tumbler before him; he was smoking and in conversation
with the girl who served him. Ashley stood still
on the threshold for a moment or two, watching this
man. "This is my man," he said to himself; he seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
to have an intuitive knowledge of the fact and not to
rely on any pose or air which he had noticed in the
photograph; he knew that he was looking at Ora's
husband, and stood and looked at him. The man had
come; he was not dead; he was here, drinking at the
bar. "How much would he take to go away again?"
That was Ashley's thought. Then he shook his head
and walked towards the man, who had just set his glass
down empty.</p>

<p>"You'll have missed the express," said the girl behind
the counter.</p>

<p>"I was bound to have a drink," protested the customer
in a rather injured tone.</p>

<p>He turned away, stooped, lifted a hand-bag, and came
down the room. Ashley noticed that his right hand was
bandaged; he thought he noticed also a slight uncertainty
in his walk; he did not lurch or stagger, but he
swayed a little. "Just sixpenn'orth too much," was
Ashley's summary. Then he walked up to the stranger
and asked if he had the honour of addressing Mr.
Fenning.</p>

<p>There remained always in Ashley Mead's mind a
memory of Jack Fenning as he was that day, of his
soft blurred voice, his abashed eyes, his slight swayings,
and the exaggerated apologetic firmness (or even aggression)
of gait that followed them, of his uneasy deference
towards the man who met him, of his obvious
and unfeigned nervousness on being told that Miss
Pinsent was waiting for him. Had child married child?
The question leapt to Ashley's thoughts. Here was no
burly ruffian, full of drink and violence. He had been
drinking, but surely as a boy who takes his second glass
of birthday port, not knowing the snake which lurks
among that pleasant, green grass? He had struck Ora;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
the ugly fact was there; yet now Ashley found himself
asking whether children had not their tempers, whether
they are to be judged as men are judged, as gentlemen
claim to be judged. Jack Fenning came neither in a
truculent resentment against his wife, nor in a masterful
assertion of his rights, nor (which would have been
worst of all) in a passion for her. He did not question
Ashley's position, he did not ask how he came to be
there; nor did he demand to be taken to his wife, nor
did he fly to seek her.</p>

<p>"She's here, is she?" he said with an unmistakable
accent of alarm.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's here. Come along. I'll take you to
her," said Ashley curtly. He was angry to find his
resentment oozing away. "Didn't you know she was
coming to meet you?"</p>

<p>"She said she might," murmured Jack. "But I
didn't think she would."</p>

<p>"I thought there'd be a crowd and so on, so I ran
down with her," Ashley explained, despising himself for
explaining at all.</p>

<p>"Awfully kind of you," said Mr. Fenning. "Where&mdash;where
did you leave her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, on a seat on the platform. Where's your luggage?"</p>

<p>"Here." He held up the hand-bag.</p>

<p>"That all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all," said Jack with a propitiatory smile.
"I didn't see the good of bringing much." He paused
and then added, "I haven't got much, you know."
Another pause followed. "I hope that&mdash;that Miss
Pinsent's all right?" he ended.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's all right. Come along." Then he asked
abruptly, "Hurt your hand?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>Jack raised his hand and looked at it. "I got it
burnt," he said. "We were making a night of it, and
some fool made the poker hot&mdash;we had an open fire&mdash;and
I didn't see it was hot and laid hold of it."
He looked at his companion's face, which wore a grim
smile. "Of course I shouldn't have done it if I hadn't
had a drop too much," he added, smiling.</p>

<p>"Good God!" groaned Ashley to himself as he led
the way. Wouldn't anything, the burly ruffian, the
crafty schemer, or even the coarse lover, have been
better than this? Any of them might have ranked as
a man, any of them might have laid a grasp on Ora and
ruled her life to some pattern. But what could or should
this poor creature do? Why, he had come at her bidding,
and now was afraid to meet her!</p>

<p>"Has she talked about me?" Jack asked timidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, a lot," said Ashley. He looked over his shoulder
and sent a very direct glance into his companion's
eyes. "She's told me all about it, or nearly all," he
added. Jack looked ashamed and acutely distressed.
Ashley felt sorry for him and cursed himself for the
feeling. "You'll get along better now, I hope," he said,
looking away. Then he smiled; it had occurred to him
to wonder what all the folk who were so interested in
the coming of Mr. Fenning would make of this Mr.
Fenning who had come. For an embodiment of respectability,
of regularity of life, and of the stability
of the conjugal relation, this creature was so&mdash;there
seemed but one word&mdash;so flabby.</p>

<p>"Is Janet still with Miss Pinsent?" asked Jack. It
was evident that he hesitated as to what he ought to
call his wife. There was a little pause before he pronounced
her name.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ashley. "Janet's there. She's ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
some whiskey you'll like." Jack, unobservant of sarcasm,
smiled gratefully; he reminded Ashley of a child
rather afraid of its parents and finding comfort in the
presence of a kind familiar nurse. "It was about here
I left Miss Pinsent," Ashley went on, glancing round.</p>

<p>There was the seat on which Ora had sat; but Ora
was not on the seat. Ashley looked about, scanning
the platform, seeking the graceful figure and gait that
he knew so well. Jack put his bag down on the seat
and stared at the roof of the station.</p>

<p>"I don't see her," said Ashley. "She must have
moved." He glanced at Jack and added with a sudden
burst of laughter, "Now you must stay here while I
look for her!"</p>

<p>"You're very kind," said Jack Fenning, sinking down
on the seat.</p>

<p>"I might be the father of twins," said Ashley, as he
walked off. Jack, left alone, furtively unclasped the
bag, sought a small bottle, and took a small mouthful
from it; he wanted all his nerve to meet his wife.</p>

<p>Again Ashley Mead searched the station and ransacked
the waiting-rooms; again in whimsical despair
he explored the refreshment saloon; all were empty.
What had become of Ora? He returned to the seat
where Jack Fenning was. A tall burly guard stood by
Jack, regarding him with a rather contemptuous smile.
When Ashley approached he turned round.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're the gentleman, sir?" he said. "Mr.
Mead, sir?"</p>

<p>"I'm Mr. Mead," said Ashley.</p>

<p>"The lady who went by the express left this note for
you, sir. I thought it was for this gentleman but he
says it isn't."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I expect it's for me," said Ashley, exchanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
a shilling for a scrap of twisted paper addressed
to him in Ora's familiar scrawl. The guard
looked at the pair with a faint curiosity, spun his
shilling in the air, and turned away. They were, after
all, a very unimportant episode in the life of the guard.</p>

<p>"I have gone. As you love me, don't let him follow
me. I am heart-broken:&mdash;Ora."</p>

<p>Thus ran the note which Ashley read. At the last
moment, then, the great drama had broken down, renunciation
and reformation had refused to run in couples,
the fine scenes would not be played and&mdash;the heroine
had fled from the theatre! An agreement was an
agreement, as Mr. Hazlewood insisted; but Ora had
broken hers. Here was Ashley Mead with a stray
husband on his hands! He laughed again as he re-read
the note. Where had she gone, poor dear, she and her
broken heart? She was crying somewhere with the
picturesqueness that she could impart even to the
violent forms of grief. His laugh made friends with a
groan as he looked down on the flabby figure of Jack
Fenning. That such a creature should make such a
coil! The world is oddly ordered.</p>

<p>"What the devil are we to do now?" he exclaimed
aloud, glancing from the note to Jack, and back from
Jack to the note. The note gave no help; Jack's bewildered
questioning eyes were equally useless. "She's
gone," Ashley explained with a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Gone? Where to?" Helplessness still, not indignation,
not even surprise, marked the tone.</p>

<p>"I don't know. You're not to follow her, she
says."</p>

<p>Jack seemed to sink into a smaller size as he muttered
forlornly,</p>

<p>"She told me to come, you know." His uninjured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
hand moved longingly but indecisively towards his bag.
"Will you have a dram?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, I won't," said Ashley. "Well, we can't stay
here all night. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand what you mean by saying she's
gone," moaned Jack.</p>

<p>"It's all she says&mdash;and that you're not to follow.
What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>His look now was severe and almost cruel; Jack
seemed to cringe under it.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he muttered. "You see I&mdash;I've
got no money."</p>

<p>"No money?"</p>

<p>"No. I had a little, but I had infernally bad luck at
poker, coming over. You wouldn't believe how the
luck ran against me."</p>

<p>Ashley put his hands in his pockets and regarded
his companion.</p>

<p>"So you've no money?"</p>

<p>"About five shillings."</p>

<p>"And now you've no wife!"</p>

<p>Jack twisted in his seat. "I wish I hadn't come,"
he said fretfully.</p>

<p>"So do I," said Ashley. "But here you are!" He
took a turn along the platform. The burly guard saw
him and touched his hat.</p>

<p>"Train for London in five minutes, sir. The last
to-night, sir. Going on?"</p>

<p>"Damn it, yes, we'll go on," said Ashley Mead. At
least there was nothing to be gained by staying there.
"Your ticket takes you through to London, I suppose?"
he asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Yes, it does; but what am I to do there?" asked
Jack forlornly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>Something restrained Ashley from the obvious retort,
"What the devil do I care?" If he abandoned Jack,
Jack must seek out Ora; he must track her by public
and miscellaneous inquiries; he must storm the small
house at Chelsea, braving Ora for the sake of Janet and
the whiskey. Or if he did not do that, he would spend
his five shillings as he had best not, and&mdash;visions of
police-court proceedings and consequential newspaper
broad-sheets rose before Ashley's eyes.</p>

<p>He took Jack to London with him. The return journey
alone with Mr. Fenning was an unconsidered case, an
unrehearsed effect. Mr. and Mrs. Fenning were to have
gone together; in one mad pleasant dream he and
Ora were to have gone together, with Jack smoking
elsewhere. Reality may fail in everything except surprises.
Ora was heaven knew where, heart-broken in
Chelsea or elsewhere, and Ashley was in charge of Mr.
Fenning.</p>

<p>"Good God, how everybody would laugh!" thought
Ashley, himself hovering between mirth and ruefulness.
The pencil of Babba Flint would draw a fine caricature
of this journey; the circumstances might wring wonder
even from Mr. Hazlewood's intimate and fatigued acquaintance
with the ways of genius; as for Kensington
Palace Gardens&mdash;Ashley suddenly laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"It's all so damned absurd," said Ashley, laughing
still. An absurd tragedy&mdash;and after all that Jack
should come as he did, be what he was, and go on
existing, was in essentials pure tragedy&mdash;seemed set
on foot. "What am I to do with the fellow?" asked
Ashley of himself. "I can't let him go to Chelsea."
Nor, on reflection, could he let him go either to the
workhouse or to the police-court. In fact, by an impulsive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span>
extension of the very habit which had appealed
so strongly to his chivalry, Ora had thrown not herself
only but her husband also on his hands!</p>

<p>London drew near, even for the slow train, and with
London came the problem. Ashley solved it in a flash,
with a resolve that preserved the mixture of despair
and humour which had become his attitude towards the
situation of affairs. Above him in his house by Charing
Cross there lived a clerk; the clerk had gone for
a month's holiday, and had given liberty to the housekeeper
to let his bed-sitting-room (so the compound
was termed) to any solvent applicant. Jack Fenning
should occupy the room for this night at least; he
would be safe from danger, from observation, from causing
trouble at Chelsea or wherever his wife might be.
Thus to provide for him seemed mere humanity; he
had but five shillings and a weakness for strong drink;
and although he had struck Ora (the violence grew
more and more inconceivable), yet in a sense he belonged
to her. "And something must happen to clear
it all up soon," Ashley reflected in an obstinate conviction
that things in the end went reasonably.</p>

<p>A short interview with the housekeeper was enough
to arrange for Jack Fenning's immediate comfort; then
Ashley took him into his own room and gave him an
improvised supper, and some whiskey and water mixed
very weak; Jack regarded it disconsolately but made
no protest; he lugged out a pipe and began to smoke,
staring the while into the empty grate. "I wonder where
she's gone!" he said once, but Ashley was putting on his
slippers and took no notice of the question. There
lay on the table a note and a telegram; Jack's eyes
wandered to them. "Perhaps the wire's from her," he
suggested timidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Ashley, taking it up. But the message
was from Alice Muddock and ran, "Father had
a paralytic stroke to-day. Afraid serious. Will you
come to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"It's not from Miss Pinsent," said Ashley, as he
turned to the note. This was from Bowdon, sent by
hand: "I'm glad to say that I've persuaded Irene
to be married in a month from now. As you're such
a friend of hers as well as of mine, I hope you'll be my
best man on the occasion."</p>

<p>"And the note's not from her either," said Ashley,
walking up to the mantel-piece and filling his pipe.</p>

<p>Jack leant back in his chair and gulped down his
weak mixture; he looked up in Ashley's face and
smiled feebly. Ashley's brows were knit, but his lips
curved in a smile. The mixed colours held the field;
here was poor old Sir James come to the end of his
work, to the end of new blocks and the making of
sovereigns; here was Bowdon triumphantly setting the
last brick on the high wall behind which he had entrenched
himself against the assault of wayward inclinations.
Was Irene then at peace? Would Bob hold his
own or would Bertie Jewett grasp the reins? Was
Bowdon resigned or only fearful? What a break-up in
Kensington Palace Gardens! What the deuce should
he do with this man? And where in heaven's name was
Ora Pinsent? Ashley's eyes fell on a couple of briefs
which had been sent after him from the Temple; it
seemed as though the ordinary work of life were in
danger of neglect.</p>

<p>"We can't do anything to-night, you know," he said
to Jack in an irritated tone. "You don't want to
knock her up to-night, I suppose, even if she's at her
house?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>"No," said Jack meekly.</p>

<p>"Are you ready for bed then?"</p>

<p>Jack cast one longing glance at the whiskey bottle,
and said that he was. Ashley led him upstairs, turned
on the gas, and shewed him the room he was to occupy.
Desiring to appear friendly, he lingered a few moments
in desultory and forced conversation, and, seeing that
Jack's wounded hand crippled him a little, began to
help him to take his things out of the bag and lay them
in handy places. Jack accepted his services with regard
to the bag, and set about emptying his own pockets on
the mantel-piece. Presently Ashley, his task done,
turned round to see his companion standing with back
turned, under the gas jet; he seemed to be regarding
something which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>"I think you'll be all right now," said Ashley, preparing
to make his escape.</p>

<p>Jack faced round with a slight start and an embarrassed
air. He still held in his hand the object which
he had been regarding; Ashley now perceived it to be
a photograph. Was it Ora's&mdash;Ora's, treasured through
years of separation, of quarrel, of desertion and apparent
neglect? Had the man then grace in him so to love
Ora Pinsent? A flash of kindliness lit up Ashley's feelings
towards him; a pang of sympathy went near to
making him sorry that Ora had fled from welcoming
the home-comer. His eyes rested on Jack with a
friendly look; Jack responded with a doubtful wavering
smile; he seemed to ask whether he could in truth
rely on the new benevolence which he saw in his host's
eyes. Ashley smiled, half at his own queer thoughts,
half to encourage the poor man. The smile nourished
Jack's growing confidence; with a roguish air which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
had not been visible before he held out the picture
to Ashley, saying,</p>

<p>"Pretty girl, isn't she?"</p>

<p>With a stare Ashley took the portrait. It could not
be Ora's, if he spoke of it like that; so it seemed to
the lover who translated another's feelings into his own.
In an instant he retracted; that was how Jack Fenning
would speak of Ora; short-lived kindliness died away;
the man was frankly intolerable. But the sight of the
picture sent his mind off in another direction. The picture
was not Ora's, unless in previous days Ora had
been of large figure, of bold feature, of self-assertive
aspect, given to hats outrageous, and to signing herself,
"Yours ever, Daisy." For such were the salient characteristics
of the picture which Mr. Jack Fenning had
brought home with him. A perverse freak of malicious
memory carried Ashley back to the room in the little
house at Chelsea, where his own portrait stood in its
silver frame on the small table by Ora's favourite seat.
<i>Mutato nomine, de te!</i> But, lord, what a difference the
name makes!</p>

<p>"Very pretty," he remarked, handing back the image
which had occasioned his thought. "Some one you
know on the other side?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jack, standing the picture up against the
wall.</p>

<p>Ashley was absurdly desirous of questioning him, of
learning more about Daisy, of discovering whether Mr.
Fenning had his romance or merely meditated in tranquillity
on a pleasant friendship. But he held himself
back; he would not be more mixed up with the man
than fate and Ora Pinsent had commanded. There was
something squalid about the man, so that he seemed to
infect what he touched with his own flabby meanness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
How in the world had Ora come to make him her husband?
No doubt five years of whiskey, in society of
which Daisy was probably too favourable a specimen to
be typical, would account for much. He need not have
been repulsive always; he might even have had a fawning
attractiveness; it hung oddly about him still. But
how could he ever have commanded love? Love asks
more, some material out of which to fashion an ideal,
some nobility actual or potential. At this point his reflections
were very much in harmony with the views of
Alice Muddock. He hated to think what Ora had been
to this man; now he thanked God that she had run
away. He would have liked himself to run away somewhere,
never to see Jack Fenning, to forget that he had
ever seen him, to rid Ora of every association with him.
It was odious that the thought of her must bring the
thought of Fenning; how soon would he be able to
think of her again without this man shouldering his way
into recollection by her side? Until he could achieve
that, she herself, suffering an indignity, almost seemed
to suffer a taint.</p>

<p>"Good-night," said he. "We'll have a talk in the
morning about what's to be done."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mr. Mead. I'm&mdash;I'm awfully obliged
to you for everything."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Ashley. He moved towards the
door. As he passed the table his eye fell on Jack's
flask, which lay there. For an instant he thought of
cautioning Jack against an excessive use of it; but
where was the good and why was it his business?
Without more he left his unwelcome guest to himself.</p>

<p>And Jack, being thus left alone, had some more
whiskey, another look at his picture, and another smoke
of his pipe. After that he began to consider how very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span>
hardly his wife had used him. Or, rather, he tried to
take up and maintain this position, but he failed. He
was so genuinely relieved that Ora had not been there;
he did not want to meet Ora; he knew that he would
be terribly uncomfortable. Why had he come? He
wandered up to the mantel-piece again and looked with
pathetic reproach at the picture and the signature below
it.</p>

<p>"I wish she hadn't made me!" he groaned as he
turned away and began to undress himself.</p>

<p>Ora had allowed him to come, but it could hardly be
said that she had made him. Moreover his protest
seemed to be addressed to the picture on the mantel-piece.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a><span>CHAPTER XIV</span>
<span class="smaller">AS MR. FLINT SAID</span></h2>


<p>Irene Kilnorton looked, as she had been bidden,
out of the window in Queen's Gate and perceived
a four-wheeled cab laden with three large boxes;
from that sight she turned her eyes again to Ora
Pinsent, who sat in a straight-backed chair with an
expression of unusual resolution on her face. It was
eleven o'clock on Monday morning.</p>

<p>"I lay awake all night, trembling," said Ora. "Imagine
if he'd come to the house!"</p>

<p>"But, good gracious, you told him to come, Ora!
You must see him now."</p>

<p>"I won't. I thought you'd be kind and come with
me; but I'm going anyhow."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I suppose Ashley has done something
with him; only I wonder I haven't had a letter."</p>

<p>"Ashley!" Lady Kilnorton's tone fully explained
her brief remark, but Ora only nodded her head and
repeated, "Yes, Ashley."</p>

<p>"And where do you propose to go?"</p>

<p>"Devonshire."</p>

<p>"And what about your theatre?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've sent a wire. The understudy must do it.
I couldn't possibly."</p>

<p>"And are you going alone to Devonshire?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>"Yes. At least I suppose Ashley couldn't go with
me, could he?"</p>

<p>"He would if you asked him, I should think," said
Irene most impatiently.</p>

<p>"He can run down and see me, though," observed
Ora in a slightly more cheerful tone. "I shall wire my
address and ask him to let me know what&mdash;what happened.
Only&mdash;only I'm rather afraid to know. I
should like just to leave it all to Ashley."</p>

<p>"I think you're quite mad."</p>

<p>"I was nearly, at the thought of meeting him. I
wonder what Ashley did with him." A faint and timid
smile appeared on her lips as she looked at her friend.
"Their meeting must have been rather funny," she
added, with obvious fear, but yet unable to resist confiding
her amusement.</p>

<p>"Did anybody ever beat you, Ora?" demanded Lady
Kilnorton.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," confessed Ora plaintively.</p>

<p>"Then they didn't do it enough, that's all."</p>

<p>Ora sat silent for a moment still, smiling a little.</p>

<p>"It's no good being unkind to me," she remarked
then. "I don't see how I could have done anything
else. I did my very best to&mdash;to let him come; but
I couldn't."</p>

<p>"It's not very likely you could, when you'd been
spending every hour of the day with Ashley Mead!
Actually took him to meet your husband!"</p>

<p>"I suppose it was that, partly; but I couldn't have
got even as far as I did without Ashley. Why won't
you come to Devonshire?"</p>

<p>"Among other things, I'm going to be married."</p>

<p>"Oh! Soon?"</p>

<p>"In a month."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>"Really? How splendid! I should think Lord
Bowdon's a lovely lover. I'm sure he would be." Ora
was now smiling very happily.</p>

<p>Irene seemed to consider something seriously for a
moment or two; then she gave it utterance.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you're disreputable, after all," she said.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," protested Ora. "Oh, but, my dear,
how I should like to be! It would simplify everything
so. But then Ashley&mdash;" She broke off and frowned
pensively.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean exactly what you've done, but
what you are." She came suddenly across the room,
bent down, and kissed Ora's cheek. Then, as she
straightened herself again, she said, "I don't think we
can be friends."</p>

<p>At first Ora laughed, but, seeing Irene very grave,
she looked at her with scared eyes. Irene met her gaze
fully and directly.</p>

<p>"You didn't tell me all Alice Muddock said to you,"
said Irene.</p>

<p>"No, not quite," Ora murmured; "it was horrid."</p>

<p>"She's told me since. Well, she only said what
you've made us all think of you."</p>

<p>"You?" asked Ora, her eyes still set on her friend.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Irene Kilnorton, and, turning away, she
sat down by the window. A silence followed, broken
only by a stamp of the hoof from the cab-horse at the
door. Then Irene spoke again. "Don't you see that
you can't go on as you've been going on, that it's impossible,
that it ruins everybody's life who has anything
to do with you? Don't you see how you're treating
your husband? Don't you see what you're doing to
Ashley Mead?"</p>

<p>Ora had turned rather white, as she had when Alice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>
Muddock told her that not for the sake of fame would
she pay Ora's price. They were both against her.</p>

<p>"How hard people are!" she cried, rising and
walking about the room. "Women, I mean," she
added a moment later.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you make men think what you like,"
said Irene scornfully. "We women see what's true.
I'm sure I don't want to distress you, Ora."</p>

<p>Ora was looking at her in despair tempered by curiosity.
Bitterly as she had felt Alice's onslaught, she
had ended in explaining it to herself by saying that
Alice was an exceptionally cold and severe person, and
also rather jealous concerning Ashley Mead. Irene
Kilnorton was neither cold nor severe, and Ora had no
reason to think her jealous. The agreement of the two
seemed a token and an expression of a hostile world in
arms against her, finding all sins in her, hopelessly blind
to her excuses and deaf to the cries of her heart which
to her own ears were so convincing. Irene thought
that she ought to have been beaten more; if she told of
Mr. Fenning's isolated act of violence, Irene would
probably disapprove of nothing in it except its
isolation.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd sympathise with me," she said at
last.</p>

<p>"Then you must have thought me a goose," retorted
Irene crossly. Her real feelings would have led her to
substitute "very wicked" for "a goose," but she had
an idea that an ultra-moral attitude was <i>bourgeois</i>.
"Goose" gave her all she wanted and preserved the
intellectual point of view.</p>

<p>But to Ora the moral and the intellectual were the
Scylla and Charybdis between which her frail bark of
emotions steered a perilous, bumping, grazing way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span>
lucky if it escaped entire destruction on one or the
other, or (<i>pace</i> the metaphor) on both at once. She
felt that the world was harsh and most ill-adapted to
any reasonable being; for Ora also seemed to herself
very reasonable; reason follows the habit of the chameleon
and takes colour from the tree of emotions on
which it lies. From her meditations there emerged a
sudden terrible dread that swallowed up every other feeling,
every other anxiety. All the world (must not the
world be judged by these two ladies?) was against her.
Her action was to it beyond understanding, her temperament
beyond excuse. Would Ashley feel the same?
"Have I tired him out?" she cried to herself. All else
she could surrender, though the surrender were with
tears; but not his love, his sympathy, her hold over
him. He must see, he must understand, he must approve.
She could not have him also rebelling against
her in weariness or puzzled disgust. Then indeed
there would be nothing to live for; even the refuge in
Devonshire must become an arid tormenting desert.
For the times when he could run down and see her had
gone near to obliterating all the other times in her
imaginary picture of the refuge in Devonshire: just as
her occasional appearances had filled the whole of that
picture of Ashley's married life drawn in the days of the
renunciation.</p>

<p>She rose and bade Irene good-bye with marked
abruptness; it passed as the sign of natural offence,
and kindness mingled with reproach in Irene's parting
kiss. But Irene asked no more questions and invited
no more confidences. Ora ran downstairs and jumped
into her cab. A new fear and a new excitement possessed
her; she thought no more of Irene's censure;
she asked no more what had become of Jack Fenning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>"What station, miss?" asked the driver, taking a look
at her. He had seen her from the gallery and was
haunted by a recollection.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not going to the station!" exclaimed Ora
impatiently; why did people draw unwarranted inferences
from the mere presence of three boxes on the
roof of a cab? She gave him Ashley's address with
the coolest and most matter-of-fact air she could muster.
But for the terror she was in, it would have been pleasant
to her to be going for the first time to those rooms of
his to which she had sent so many letters, so many
telegrams, so many boy-messengers, so many commissionaires,
but which in actual palpable reality she had
never seen yet. Reflecting that she had never seen
them yet, she declared that the reproaches levelled at
her were absurdly wide of the mark and horribly uncharitable.
They didn't give her credit for her real
self-control. But what was Ashley feeling? Again
she cried, "Have I tired him out?" Now she pictured
no longer from her own but from his standpoint the
scene at the station, and saw how she had left him to do
the thing which it had been hers to do. For the first
time that day a dim half-recollected vision of the renunciation
and reformation took shape in her brain; she
dubbed it at once an impossible and grotesque fantasy.
Ashley must have known it for that all the time; who
but Ashley would have been so generous and so tactful
as never to let her see his opinion of it? Who but
Ashley would have respected the shelter that she made
for herself out of its tattered folds? And now had she
lost Ashley, even Ashley? By this time Jack Fenning,
his doings, and his whereabouts, had vanished from her
mind. Ashley was everything.</p>

<p>The laden cab reached the door; Ora was out in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span>
moment. "Wait," she cried, as she darted in; the
driver shifted the three boxes, so as to make room for
additional luggage; he understood the situation now;
his fare had come to pick up somebody; they would go
to the station next.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Mead dwelt on the first floor; on the second
floor lived Mr. J. Metcalfe Brown. Having gleaned this
knowledge from names in white letters on a black board,
Ora mounted the stairs. The servant-girl caught a
glimpse of her and admired without criticising; charity
reigned here; a lady's gown was scrutinised, not her
motives. Ora reached the first floor; here again the
door was labelled with Ashley's name. The sight of it
brought a rebound to hopefulness; the spirit of the adventure
caught on her, her self-confidence revived, her
fears seemed exaggerated. At any rate she would atone
now by facing the problem of her husband in a business-like
way; she would talk the matter over reasonably
and come to some practical conclusion. She pulled her
hat straight, laughed timidly, and knocked at the door.
How surprised he'd be! And if he were disposed to be
unkind&mdash;well, would he be unkind long? He had never
been unkind long. Why, he didn't answer! Again she
knocked, and again. He must be out. This check in the
plan of campaign almost brought tears to Ora's eyes.</p>

<p>She must enquire. She was about to go downstairs
again and ring the bell when she heard a door opened
on the landing above, and a man's step. She paused;
this man might give her news of Ashley; that he might
be surprised to see her did not occur to her. A moment
later a voice she knew well exclaimed in soliloquy,
"Good heavens, what a creature!" and round the bend
of the stairs came Ashley himself, in a flannel jacket,
smoking a pipe, with his hair much disordered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>Ora wore a plain travelling frock suitable for a dusty
journey to Devonshire; her jacket was fawn colour, her
hat was black; yet even by these sober hues the landing
seemed illuminated to Ashley Mead. "Well!" he
cried, taking his pipe from his mouth and standing still.</p>

<p>"Open this door," Ora commanded, in a little tumult
of gladness; in an instant his eyes told her that she had
not tired him out. "And who's a creature?"</p>

<p>"A creature?" he asked, coming down.</p>

<p>"Yes. You said somebody was. Oh, I know! The
man above? Mr. J. Metcalfe Brown?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Ashley. "Metcalfe Brown." He
took a key out of his pocket, unlocked the door, and
held it open for her. He was laughing.</p>

<p>"So this is your den!" she cried. "What are those
papers?" The desk was strewn with white sheets.</p>

<p>"Our Commission. I've been having a morning
at it."</p>

<p>"Between it and Metcalfe Brown?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, he does need some of my attention."</p>

<p>"What a noise he makes!" said Ora, for a dragging
tread sounded on the ceiling of the room. "He must
be rather a bore?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," said Ashley, with a short laugh and a
quick amused glance at her.</p>

<p>"Where's my picture?" Ora demanded, looking
round.</p>

<p>"Strictly concealed," Ashley assured her.</p>

<p>"I wonder I've never come here before," she reflected,
sitting down in his arm-chair.</p>

<p>"Well, on the whole, so do I," said Ashley, laughing
still.</p>

<p>She was taking a careful and interested view of the
room. The steps overhead went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>"I think it would be very nice," she said at last,
"except for Metcalfe Brown."</p>

<p>"There's always something one could do without,"
observed Ashley Mead.</p>

<p>"I like you in that coat. Oh, well, I like you in
any coat. But I never saw you ready for work before.
Ashley, who is Metcalfe Brown? And how I wish he'd
sit still!"</p>

<p>"He's a clerk," said Ashley; his smile persisted, but
his brows were knit in a humorous puzzle.</p>

<p>A pause followed. Ora looked at him, smiled, looked
away, looked at him again. Ashley said nothing.</p>

<p>"You might ask me something," she murmured reproachfully.
He shook his head. She rose and came
behind him; laying a hand on his shoulder she looked
round in his face; mirth and appeal mingled as of old
in the depths of her eyes. "Am I very dreadful?" she
whispered. "Are you quite tired of me, Ashley?"</p>

<p>There was a sound from above as though a man had
thrown himself heavily on a sofa or a bed.</p>

<p>"Bother Metcalfe Brown," whispered Ora. "Ashley,
I couldn't help it. I was afraid."</p>

<p>"You needn't have been afraid with me," he said in
a low voice.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but you wouldn't have stayed. I was so frightened.
You know what I told you; I remembered it all.
He'd had too much to drink; he wasn't generally cruel,
but that made him. Ashley dear, say you forgive me?"</p>

<p>The dim sound of a quavering voice reached them
through the ceiling. For an instant Ora raised her head,
then she bent down again to Ashley.</p>

<p>"Because I'm going away, to Devonshire," she went
on. "And I mayn't see you for ever so long, unless
you'll come and see me; and Irene Kilnorton says you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[Pg 203]</span>
oughtn't to. But you must. But still it will be days!
Oh, how shall I pass days without you? So do forgive
me before I go."</p>

<p>"Forgive you!" said he with a little laugh.</p>

<p>"Ah, you do," she sighed. "How good you are,
Ashley." She pressed his shoulder with her hand. "I
couldn't go on living if it wasn't for you," she said.
"Everybody else is so hard to me. I ran away last night
because I couldn't bear to lose you!" She paused and
moved her face nearer his, as she whispered, "Could
you bear to lose me?"</p>

<p>Mr. Metcalfe Brown tumbled off the bed and seemed
to stagger across the room towards the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>"No," said Ashley Mead.</p>

<p>"But I'm going away; my boxes are on the cab outside.
I daren't stop now he's come; I might meet him;
he might&mdash;no, I daren't stay." Her voice fell yet
lower as she asked, "What did he say? Where is he?
What have you done with him?"</p>

<p>Ashley gently raised her hand from his arm, rose, and
walked to the fireplace. He looked at her as she bent
forward towards him in the tremulous eagerness of her
questioning, with fear and love fighting in her eyes, as
though she looked to him alone both for safety and for
joy. And, as it chanced, Mr. Metcalfe Brown made no
sound in the room above; it was possible altogether to
forget him.</p>

<p>Ora took the chair that Ashley had left and sat looking
at him. For a moment or two he said nothing; it
was the pause before the plunge, the last hasty reckoning
of possibilities and resources before a great stake.
Then he set all on the hazard.</p>

<p>"You needn't have run away," he said in a cool,
almost bantering tone. "Fenning didn't turn up at all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Metcalfe Brown walked across the room and threw
himself into a chair; at least the sounds from above indicated
some such actions on his part.</p>

<p>"I don't know why, but he didn't," said Ashley with
a momentary glance at the ceiling&mdash;rather as though he
feared it would fall on him.</p>

<p>"Not come?" she whispered. "Oh, Ashley!" She
seemed for a moment to hold herself in the chair by
the grasp of her hands on its arms. Then she rose and
moved slowly towards him. "He didn't come?"</p>

<p>"Not a sign of him."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and he won't, will he?"</p>

<p>"I don't expect so," said Ashley, smiling.</p>

<p>Ora seemed to accept his answer as final. She stood
still, for a moment grave, then breaking into a gurgle of
amused delighted laughter. Ashley glanced again at
the ceiling; surely a man who had ever heard that laugh
must remember it! But had the man upstairs? Was
not that laugh made and kept for him himself from the
beginning of the world? So his madness persuaded him.</p>

<p>"Rather funny, wasn't it? So I came back alone by
the slow train&mdash;a very slow train it was, without you."</p>

<p>Ora's mood was plain enough. She was delighted,
and she was hardly surprised. No instability of purpose
and no change of intention were out of harmony with
her idea of her husband. There was no telling why he
had not come, but there was nothing wonderful in his
not coming. She spread her arms out with a gesture
of candid self-approval.</p>

<p>"Well, I've done my duty," said she.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ashley, smiling. He was relieved to
find his word taken so readily. "But do you think
you're doing it by staying here?"</p>

<p>"How rude you are! Why shouldn't I?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>"It's irregular. And somebody might come." He
paused and added, "Suppose Metcalfe Brown dropped
in?"</p>

<p>"What would he think?" cried Ora with sparkling
eyes. "Is he a very steady young man?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; he's got a picture signed 'Yours
ever, Daisy,' on his mantel-piece."</p>

<p>Ora's eyes shewed no recognition of "Daisy."</p>

<p>"The girl he's engaged to, I suppose," she said rather
scornfully; high and unhappy passion is a little contemptuous
of a humdrum engagement.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Ashley cautiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's moving about again; and he's singing! I
wish we could hear better!" For the sound of the
voice was very muffled. "I know that tune though.
Where have I heard it before?"</p>

<p>"Everybody used to torture one with it a few years
ago; somebody sang it at the Alhambra."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I went with&mdash;I went once and heard it."</p>

<p>The voice died down in a gentle grumble. The little
puzzled frown with which Ora had listened also passed
away.</p>

<p>"Going to Devonshire?" asked Ashley Mead.</p>

<p>"To Devonshire? No," said Ora decisively. "Why
should I go away now?"</p>

<p>"You must go away from here."</p>

<p>"Must I, Ashley?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you must. Consider if Metcalfe Brown&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, bother your Metcalfe Brown! There's always
somebody like that!"</p>

<p>"Yes, generally. Come, I'll take you to your
cab&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you'll come and see me to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, isn't everything perfect? What's that? He
must be throwing the fire irons about!"</p>

<p>"Never mind him. Come along."</p>

<p>"I don't mind him. I don't mind anybody now.
How could I ever have thought of bringing&mdash;of doing
what I did? Why did you let me, Ashley? But it's
all right now, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Come down quietly; Metcalfe Brown'll hear us."</p>

<p>"I don't care."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must. Consider my reputation!"</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll be quiet," said Ora with another low
and joyous laugh.</p>

<p>They stole downstairs together. Metcalfe Brown was
quiet; he did not open his door, look out, glance down
the well of the stairs and see who was Ashley Mead's
companion; he sat with his pipe in his mouth and
his glass by his side, while Ora escaped in safety from
the house.</p>

<p>The cabman had employed his leisure first in recollecting
how his fare's face came to be familiar to
him, secondly (since he had thus become interested in
her), in examining the luggage labels on the three large
boxes. There was a friendliness, and also a confidence,
in his manner as he leant down from his box and
said,</p>

<p>"Paddington, Miss Pinsent?"</p>

<p>"Paddington! No," said Ora. Ashley began to
laugh. Ora laughed too, as she gave her address in
Chelsea.</p>

<p>"Where I took you up, miss?" asked the cabman.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ora, bright with amusement. "It really
must seem rather funny to him," she said in an aside
to Ashley, as she got in. The cabman himself was
calling the affair "a rum start," as he whipped up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span>
his horse. To Ashley Mead it seemed very much the
same.</p>

<p>There were, however, two people who were not very
seriously surprised, Janet the respectable servant and
Mr. Sidney Hazlewood the accomplished comedian.
They received Ora, at the house in Chelsea and at
the theatre respectively, with a very similar wrinkling
of the forehead and a very similar sarcastic curving
of the lips; to both of them the ways of genius were
well known. "Mr. Fenning hasn't come after all,"
said Ora to Janet, while to Mr. Hazlewood she observed
"I felt so much better that I've come after all." Janet
said, "Indeed, ma'am." Mr. Hazlewood said, "All
right," and sent word to the understudy that she was
not wanted. On the whole her sudden change of plan
seemed to Ora to cause less than its appropriate sensation&mdash;except
to the cabman, whose demeanour had
been quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>As Mr. Hazlewood was dressing for his part, it
chanced that Babba Flint came in, intent on carrying
through an arrangement rich, as were all Babba's, in
prospective thousands. When the scheme had been
discussed, Hazlewood mentioned Ora's wire of the
morning and Ora's appearance in the evening. Babba
nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p>"Something to do with the husband perhaps,"
Hazlewood hazarded. "Not that it needs any particular
explanation," he added, hiding his wrinkle with
some paint.</p>

<p>"Husband, husband?" said Babba in a puzzle. "Oh,
yes! By Jove, he was to come yesterday! Hasn't
turned up, of course?"</p>

<p>"Haven't seen or heard anything of him."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Babba placidly. "I knew he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span>
wouldn't. I told Bowdon he wouldn't, but Bowdon
wouldn't bet. Give me a wire, though."</p>

<p>Hazlewood's dresser was ready with a telegraph-form
and Babba, in the wantonness of exuberant triumph,
sent a message to Bowdon's house asserting positively
that Mr. Fenning had not come. That evening Bowdon
dined with Irene, and the telegram, forwarded by messenger,
reached him there. After dinner Alice ran in
to give news of a rather better character concerning
her father. She also heard the contents of Babba
Flint's message. Ora's underlying desire for a sensation
would have been satisfied. They were all amazed.</p>

<p>"This morning she thought he had come," Irene
persisted. "I wonder if Ashley Mead knows anything
about it. Have you seen him, Alice?"</p>

<p>"No; he telegraphed that he couldn't possibly
come to Kensington Palace Gardens to-day, but would
early to-morrow."</p>

<p>Alice's tone was cold; Ashley ought to have gone to
Kensington Palace Gardens that day, she thought.</p>

<p>"It's very odd, isn't it, Frank?" asked Irene.</p>

<p>"It's not our affair," said Bowdon; he was rather
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Except," said Irene with a glance at Alice and an
air of reserved determination, "that we have to consider
a little what sort of person she really is. I don't know
what to make of it, do you, Alice?"</p>

<p>No less puzzled was Ashley Mead as he kept guard
on the man to whom he had transferred the name of
Metcalfe Brown, and wondered how he was to persevere
in his assertion that the man had not come. For here
the man was, and, alas, by now the man was peevishly
anxious to see his wife; from no affection, Ashley
was ready to swear, but, as it seemed, in a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>
fretful excitement. No doubt even to such a creature
the present position was uncomfortable; possibly it
appeared even degrading.</p>

<p>"We'll settle about that to-morrow," said Ashley
Mead; and in spite of a pang of self-reproach he
added, "Have a little drop more whiskey?"</p>

<p>For to-night must be tided over; and whiskey was
the only tide that served.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a><span>CHAPTER XV</span>
<span class="smaller">THE MAN UPSTAIRS</span></h2>


<p>Kensington Palace Gardens, whither Ashley
Mead hastened early on Tuesday morning, was
not the same place to him as it had been. The change
went deeper than any mere shadow of illness or atmosphere
of affliction. There was alienation, a sense of
difference, the feeling of a suppressed quarrel. The old
man knew him, but greeted him with a feeble fretfulness,
Lady Muddock was distantly and elaborately polite,
even in Bob a constraint appeared. Alice received him
kindly, but there was no such gladness at his coming as
had seemed to be foreshadowed by her summons of
him. Was she resentful that he had not come the day
before? That was likely enough, for his excuses of
pressing business did not sound very convincing even
to himself. But here again he sought a further explanation
and found it in a state of things curiously unwelcome
to him. It may be easy to abdicate; it is probably
harder to stand by patiently while the new monarch
asserts his sway and receives homage. Bertie Jewett
was in command at Kensington Palace Gardens; when
Sir James could talk he called Bertie and conferred
with him; on him now Lady Muddock leaned, to him
Bob abandoned the position by birth his own; it was
his advice which Alice repeated, his opinions which she
quoted to Ashley Mead as they took a turn together in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span>
the garden. Both business and family, the big house
and the big block, owned a new master; Bertie's star
rose steadily.</p>

<p>Ashley was prepared with infinite scorn. He watched
the upstart with an eye acute to mark his lapses of
breeding, of taste, and of tact, to discern the vulgarity
through affected ease, the coarseness of mind beneath
the superficial helpfulness. Something of all these he
contrived to see or to persuade himself that he saw, but
a whole-hearted confident contempt denied itself to him.
There is a sort of man intolerable while he is making
his way, while he pushes and disputes and shoulders
for place; the change which comes over him when his
position is won, and what he deems his rights acknowledged,
is often little less than marvellous. It is as
though the objectionable qualities, which had seemed
so ingrained in him and so part of him that they must
be his from cradle to grave and perhaps beyond, were
after all only armour he has put on or weapons he has
taken into his hand of his own motion, to do his work;
the work done they are laid aside, or at least so hidden
as merely to suggest what before they displayed offensively.
So concealed, they are no longer arrogant or
domineering, but only imply a power in reserve; they
do no more than remind the rash of what has been and
may be again. In part this great transformation had
passed over Bertie Jewett; the neat compact figure,
the resolute eye, the determined mouth, the brief confident
directions, wrung even from Ashley admiration
and an admission that, if (as poor old Sir James used to
say) the "stuff" was in himself, it was in Bertie also,
and probably in fuller measure. Neither business nor
family would lack a good counsellor and a bold leader;
neither family nor business would suffer by the substitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span>
of Bertie for himself. Watching his successor, he
seemed to himself to have become superfluous, suddenly
to have lost his place in the inmost hearts of these
people, and to have fallen back to the status of a mere
ordinary friendship.</p>

<p>Was that in truth Alice's mood towards him? It was
not, but his jealous acuteness warned him that it soon
might be. She did not tell him now that she disliked
Bertie Jewett; she praised Bertie with repentant generosity,
seeking opportunities to retract without too much
obtrusiveness the hard things she had said, and fastening
with eager hand on all that could be commended.
Ashley walked by her, listening.</p>

<p>"Where we should be without him now I don't
know," she said. "I can't do much, and Bob&mdash;well,
Bob wants somebody to guide him."</p>

<p>"I hope you'll let me be of any use I can," he said;
in spite of himself the words sounded idle and empty.</p>

<p>"You're most kind, Ashley, always, but I don't
think there's anything we need trouble you about for
the present. We don't expect any immediate change
in father."</p>

<p>"When I said I wouldn't have anything to do with
the business, I didn't include Kensington Palace
Gardens in the word."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you didn't. Indeed I'll ask you for
help when I want it."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment or two. Then he said,
"You agreed with me about the business. Do you
still think I was right?"</p>

<p>"I'm more than ever sure of it," she answered with
a direct gaze at him. "I grow surer of it every day.
It wasn't the least suited to you; nor you to it, you
know." She smiled as she spoke the last words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>"And Jewett's in his element?"</p>

<p>"I hear he's wonderfully able, and he's very nice
and considerate about everything too. Oh, no, you'd
never have done for it."</p>

<p>What she said was what she had always said; she
had always been against his selling the ribbons, had
thought that he was too good to sell ribbons and loved
him for this very thing. But the same words may
carry most different implications; was not the idea in
her head now that, if it would not have been good for
him to sell the ribbons, neither would it have been good
for the ribbons nor for the family whose prosperity depended
on them? Her smile had been indulgent rather
than admiring; he accused her of reverting to the commercial
view of life and of suffering a revival of the
family prejudices and of the instinct for getting and
reverencing wealth. He felt further from her and detected
a corresponding feeling in her. He studied her
in the light of that unreasonable resentment with which
Bertie Jewett inspired him; he saw that she read him
in the light of her judgment of Ora Pinsent; and he
knew tolerably well what she thought and said of Ora
Pinsent. They were further apart. Yet at the end old
kindliness revived and he clasped her hand very heartily.</p>

<p>"I'm always at your orders," he said. "Always."</p>

<p>She smiled; did she intend to remind him that the
day before he had neglected her summons? His conscience
gave her smile that meaning, and he could not
tell her that he had been obliged to play jailer to
Mr. Fenning&mdash;for Mr. Fenning had not come! But her
smile was not reproachful; it was still indulgent. She
seemed to expect him to say such things, to know he
would, to accept them as his sincere meaning at the
time, but not to expect too much from them, not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
take them quite literally, not to rely on them with the
simple ample faith that the words of a solid trustworthy
man receive. The love that has lived on admiration
may live with indulgence; she seemed still to love
him although now with opened eyes. And when he
was gone, she turned back to the business of life with a
sigh, to business and Bertie Jewett. Back she went to
work, and in her work Ashley Mead had no longer a
place.</p>

<p>At this time, among his conquests&mdash;and they were
over himself as well as others&mdash;Bertie Jewett achieved
a complete victory over Irene Kilnorton's old dislike of
him. He was so helpful, so unobtrusive, so strong, so
different from feather-headed people who were here one
moment and elsewhere the next, whom you never knew
where to have. She had what was nearly a quarrel with
Bowdon because he observed that, when all was said
and done, Bertie was not a gentleman.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Frank," she said tartly. "He only wants
to go into society a little more. In all essentials he's a
perfect gentleman."</p>

<p>Bowdon shook his head in impenetrable, silent, male
obstinacy. He was not apt at reasons or definitions,
but he knew when he did and when he did not see a
gentleman before him; he and his ancestors had spent
generations in acquiring this luxury of knowledge. His
shake of the head exasperated Irene.</p>

<p>"I like him very much," she said. "He has just the
qualities that made me like you. One can depend on
him; he's not harum-scarum and full of whims. You
can trust yourself with men like that."</p>

<p>"I hope I'm not as dull as I sound, my dear," said
Bowdon patiently.</p>

<p>"Dull! Who said you were dull? I said I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
trust you, and I said I could trust Bertie Jewett. Oh,
I don't mean to say he's fascinating like Ashley
Mead. At least I suppose Ashley is fascinating to most
people."</p>

<p>"Most women anyhow," murmured Bowdon.</p>

<p>"I consider," said Irene solemnly, "that Ora Pinsent
has done him infinite harm."</p>

<p>"Poor Miss Pinsent!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course it's 'Poor Miss Pinsent'! If
you'd been in the Garden of Eden you'd have said
nothing but 'Poor Eve'! But, Frank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"I believe Alice is getting tired of him at last."</p>

<p>Here was a useful conquest&mdash;and a valuable ally&mdash;for
Bertie Jewett. Bowdon perceived the bent of Irene's
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he muttered gently, between half-opened
lips. Then he smiled to himself a little ruefully.
Was Alice also to seek a refuge? Remorse came hard
on the heels of this ungracious thought, and he kissed
Irene gallantly.</p>

<p>"Suppose," he suggested, "that you were to be content
with looking after your own wedding for the present
and leave Miss Muddock to look after hers."</p>

<p>Irene, well pleased, returned his kiss, but she also
nodded sagaciously, and said that if he waited he would
see.</p>

<p>Bowdon was now so near his marriage, so near inviolable
safety, that he allowed himself the liberty of thinking
about Ora Pinsent and consequently of Ashley
Mead. That the husband had not come&mdash;Babba's
triumphant telegram was still in his pocket&mdash;surprised
as much as it annoyed him. In absence from Ora he
was able to condemn her with a heartiness which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>
<i>fiancée</i> herself need not have despised; that his condemnation
could not be warranted to outlast a single
interview with its object was now no matter to him, but
merely served to explain the doings of Ashley. Ashley
was hopelessly in the toils, this was clear enough.
Strangely hovering between self-congratulation on his
own escape and envy of the man who had not run
away, Bowdon asked what was to be the end, and, as a
man of the world, saw but one end. Ashley would pay
dear and would feel every penny of the payment. His
was a nature midway between Ora's and Irene's, perhaps
it had something even of Alice Muddock's; he had a
foot in either camp. Reason struggled with impulse in
him, and when he yielded he was still conscious of what he
lost. He could not then be happy, and he would hardly
find contentment in not being very unhappy. He must
be tossed about and torn in two. Whither would he go
in the end? "Anyhow I'm safe," was Bowdon's unexpressed
thought, given new life and energy by the
news that Ora Pinsent's husband had not come. For
now the tongues would be altogether unchained, and
defence of her hopeless. Had she ever meant him to
come, ever believed that he was coming, ever done
more than fling a little unavailing dust in the world's
keen eyes? The memory of her, strong even in its decay,
rose before him, and forbade him to embrace heartily
what was Irene's and would be everybody's theory. But
what other theory was there?</p>

<p>Bowdon was living in his father's house in Park Lane,
and these meditations brought him to the door. A servant
awaited him with the news that Ashley was in the
library and wanted to see him. The business of their
Commission brought Ashley often, and it was with only
a faint sense of coincidence that Bowdon went in to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>
meet him. Ashley was sitting on a sofa, staring at the
ceiling. He sprang up as Bowdon entered; there was
a curious nervousness in his air.</p>

<p>"Here you are, Bowdon!" he cried. Bowdon noticed,
without resenting, the omission of his title; hitherto, in
deference to seniority and Bowdon's public position,
Ashley had insisted on saying "Lord Bowdon." He
inferred that Ashley's mind was busy.</p>

<p>"Here I am, Ashley. What do you want? More
witnesses, more reports, what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's not the Commission at all."</p>

<p>"Take a cigar and tell me what it is."</p>

<p>Ashley obeyed and began to smoke quickly; he stood
now, while Bowdon dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>"In about a month I shall have seven hundred pounds
coming in," said Ashley. "Just now I've only a hundred
at the bank."</p>

<p>"Present economy and the prospect of future recompense,"
said Bowdon, smiling.</p>

<p>"I want five hundred now, to-day. They'll give it
me at the bank if I get another name. Will you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I won't give you my name, but I'll lend you five
hundred."</p>

<p>Ashley looked down at him. "Thank you," he said.
"Do you trust your servant?"</p>

<p>"More than you, Ashley, and I'm lending you five
hundred."</p>

<p>"Then send him round to the bank."</p>

<p>"My good fellow, I can write a cheque."</p>

<p>"No, I want five hundred-pound notes&mdash;new ones,"
said Ashley, with his first glimmer of a smile.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Bowdon. He went to the table,
wrote a cheque, rang the bell, and, when his personal
servant had been summoned, repeated Ashley's request.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span>
"Very good, my lord," said the man, and vanished.
Bowdon lit a cigarette and resumed his seat.</p>

<p>"It's for&mdash;," Ashley began.</p>

<p>"As you like about that," said Bowdon. "Only why
were they to be new hundred-pound notes?"</p>

<p>"In order to appeal to the imagination. I'm going
to tell you about it."</p>

<p>"As long as it's because you want and not because
I want, all right."</p>

<p>"I believe I'm going to do a damned rascally thing."</p>

<p>"Can't you keep it to yourself then?" asked Bowdon,
with a plaintive intonation and a friendly look. "At
present I've lent you five hundred. That's all! They
can't hit me."</p>

<p>"I want somebody to know besides me, and I've
chosen you."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," muttered Bowdon resignedly.</p>

<p>Ashley walked twice across the room and came to a
stand again opposite his friend.</p>

<p>"The notes are for Miss Pinsent's husband," said
he.</p>

<p>Bowdon looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said he, with lifted brows.</p>

<p>"I mean what I say; for Fenning."</p>

<p>"As the price of not coming?"</p>

<p>"Who told you he hadn't come?"</p>

<p>"Babba Flint; but it's all over the place by now."</p>

<p>"Babba's wrong," said Ashley. "He came on Sunday
night. The notes are to bribe him to go away
again."</p>

<p>There was a pause; then Bowdon said slowly:</p>

<p>"I should like to hear a bit more about this, if you
don't mind, Ashley. The money's yours. I promised
it. But still&mdash;since you've begun, you know!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Ashley quickly. "Look here,
I'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p>The hands ticked the best part of the way round the
clock while Ashley talked without pause and uninterrupted,
save once when the notes were brought in and
laid on the table. He told how the man had come,
what the man was, how Ora had fled from him, and
how, while the man moved about in the room above, he
himself had told her that the man had not come. He
broke off here for an instant to say, "You can understand
how I came to tell her that?" On receiving Bowdon's
assenting nod he went on to describe how for two
days he had kept his prisoner quiet; but now he must
take some step. "I must take him to her, or I must
murder him, or I must bribe him," he ended, with the
laugh that accompanies what is an exaggeration in
sound but in reality not beyond truth.</p>

<p>"I don't like it," said Bowdon at the end.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen him as I have," was Ashley's
quick retort. To him it seemed all sufficient.</p>

<p>"Used to beat her, did he?" Bowdon was instinctively
bolstering up the case. Ashley hesitated a little
in his answer.</p>

<p>"She said he struck her once. I'm bound to say he
doesn't seem violent. Drink, I suppose. And she&mdash;well,
it might seem worse than it was. Why the devil
are we to consider him? He's impossible anyhow."</p>

<p>"I wasn't considering him. I was considering ourselves."</p>

<p>"I'm considering her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know your state of mind. Well, and if he
takes the money and goes?"</p>

<p>"She'll be quit of him. It'll be as it was before."</p>

<p>"Will it?" asked Bowdon quietly. The two men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
regarded one another with a long and steady gaze.
Ashley's eyes did not shirk the encounter.</p>

<p>"I mean that," he said at last. "But&mdash;." He
shrugged his shoulders slightly. He would do his
best, but he could answer for nothing. He invited
Bowdon to take his stand by him, to fix his attention
only on saving her the ordeal which had proved beyond
her strength, just to spare her pain, to ask nothing of
what lay beyond, not to look too anxiously at the tools
they were using or the dirt that the tools might leave on
their hands. Bowdon gained a sudden understanding
of what Irene Kilnorton had meant by saying that Ora
did Ashley infinite harm; but above this recognition
and in spite of it rose his old cry so scorned by Irene,
"Poor Ora Pinsent!" To him as to Ashley Mead the
thought of carrying this man to Ora Pinsent and saying,
"You sent for him, here he is," was well nigh
intolerable.</p>

<p>They were both men who had lived, as men like them
mostly live, without active religious feelings, without any
sense of obligation to do good, but bound in the strictest
code of honour, Pharisees in the doctrine and canons
of that law, fierce to resent the most shamefaced
prompting of any passion which violated it. A rebel
rose against it&mdash;was it not rebellion?&mdash;drawing
strength from nowhere save from the pictured woe in
Ora Pinsent's eyes. They sat smoking in silence, and
now looked no more at one another.</p>

<p>"It's got nothing to do with me," Bowdon broke out
once.</p>

<p>"Then take back your money," said Ashley with a
wave of his hand towards the notes on the table.</p>

<p>"You're on the square with me, anyhow," said Bowdon
with a reluctant passing smile. He wished that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>
Ashley had been less scrupulous and had taken his
money without telling him what use he meant to put
it to.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, you'd better come and see the
fellow," said Ashley. "That'll persuade you I'm right,
if anything will."</p>

<p>Bowdon had become anxious to be persuaded that
the thing was right, or at least so excusable as to be
near enough to the right, as to involve no indefensible
breach of his code, no crying protest from his honour;
if the sight of the man would convince him, he was
ready and eager to see the man. Besides, he had a
curiosity. Ora had married the man; this adventitious
interest hung about Jack Fenning still.</p>

<p>"Pocket the notes, and come along," he said, rising.</p>

<p>They were very silent as they drove down to Ashley's
rooms. The affair did not need, and perhaps would
not bear, much talking about; if one of them happened
to put it in the wrong way they would both feel very
uncomfortable; it could be put in a right way, they
said to themselves, but so much care was needed for
this that silence seemed safer. Bowdon was left in
Ashley's rooms while Ashley went upstairs to fetch
Mr. Fenning, whom he found smoking his pipe and
staring out of the window. Ashley had made up his
mind to carry matters with a high hand.</p>

<p>"I want you downstairs a minute or two," he said
curtly.</p>

<p>"All right; I shall be jolly glad of a change," said
Jack, with his feeble smile. "It's pretty slow here, I
can tell you."</p>

<p>"Hope you won't have much more of it," Ashley
remarked, as he led the way downstairs.</p>

<p>To suggest to a man that he is of such a disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
as to be ready to surrender his claim to his wife's
society, take himself off for good, and leave her fate
in the hands of gentlemen who are not related to her
in consideration of five hundred pounds, is to intimate
that you hold a very peculiar opinion of him. Even
with Jack Fenning Ashley felt the difficulties of the
position. Bowdon gave him no help, but sat by, watching
attentively. The high-handed way was the only
way; but it seemed rather brutal to bully the creature.</p>

<p>Ashley began. In a pitiless fashion he hinted to Jack
what he was, and hazarded the surmise that he set out
to rejoin his wife for much the same reason which Babba
Flint had thought would appeal to him. Bowdon waited
for the outbreak of anger and the flame of resentment.
Jack smiled apologetically and rubbed his hands against
one another.</p>

<p>The other two exchanged a glance; their work grew
easier; it seemed also to grow more disgusting. The
man was passive in their hands; they had it all to do;
the responsibility was all theirs.</p>

<p>"We propose, Mr. Fenning, that you should return
to America at once, without seeing Miss Pinsent or
informing her of your arrival. You have lost time
and incurred expense&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;no doubt you're
disappointed. We shall consider all this in a liberal
spirit." Ashley's speech ended here; he was inclined
to add, "I'll deal with you as one scoundrel with
another."</p>

<p>"Go back now, without seeing her?" Was there
actually a sparkle of pleasure, or relief, or thankfulness
in his eye? Ashley nodded, took out the notes, and
laid them on the table. Bowdon shifted his feet, lit a
cigarette, and looked away from his companions out of
the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>"I have here five hundred pounds. If you'll take
the first boat and slip away without letting your&mdash;er&mdash;visit
be known to anybody, I'll hand them over to you,
when you step on board."</p>

<p>Jack shook his head thoughtfully. "You see I'm
out of a place," he said. "I threw up my position to
come."</p>

<p>He was haggling about the price, nothing else;
Bowdon got up and opened the window.</p>

<p>"I made a sacrifice for the sake of returning to Miss
Pinsent; my expenses have been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, how much do you want?" said
Bowdon, turning round on him.</p>

<p>"There's a little spec I know of&mdash;" began Jack,
with a confidential smile.</p>

<p>"How much?" said Ashley.</p>

<p>"I think you ought to run to a thousand, Mr. Mead.
A thousand's not much for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doing what you're doing? No, it's damned little,"
said Ashley Mead.</p>

<p>"Give him the money, Ashley," said Bowdon from
the window.</p>

<p>"All right, I'll give it you when I see you on board.
Mind you hold your tongue while you're here!"</p>

<p>Jack was smiling happily; he seemed like a man who
has brought off a great <i>coup</i> which was almost beyond
his hopes, in which, at least, he had never expected to
succeed so readily and easily. Looking at him, Ashley
could not doubt that if he and Bowdon had not furnished
means for the "little spec" Ora Pinsent would have
been asked to supply them.</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to go back. I never wanted to
come. I didn't want to bother Miss Pinsent. I've my
own friends." There was a sort of bravado about him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>
now. "Somebody'll be glad to see me, anyhow," he
ended with a laugh.</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Ashley Mead; his tone was civil;
he loathed Mr. Fenning more and more, but it was not
the moment for him to get on moral stilts. Bowdon
was as though he had become unconscious of Jack's
proximity.</p>

<p>"There's a boat to-morrow; I'll try for a passage on
that."</p>

<p>"The sooner the better," Ashley said.</p>

<p>"Yes, the sooner the better," said Fenning. He
looked doubtfully at the two men and glanced across to
a decanter of whiskey which stood on a side table.</p>

<p>"Then we needn't say any more," Ashley remarked,
hastily gathering the crisp notes in his hand; Jack
eyed them longingly. "I'll see you again to-night.
Good-bye." He nodded slightly. Bowdon sat motionless.
Again Jack looked at both, and his face fell a
little. Then he brightened up; there was whiskey upstairs
also. "Good afternoon," he said, and moved
towards the door; he did not offer to shake hands with
Bowdon; he knew that Bowdon would not wish to
shake hands with him; and the knowledge did not
trouble him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ashley, my boy, Ashley!" groaned Bowdon
when the door closed behind Mr. Fenning.</p>

<p>"He came to blackmail her."</p>

<p>"Evidently. But&mdash;I say, Ashley, was he always like
that?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Ashley Mead almost fiercely.
"He must have been going down hill for years. Good
God, Bowdon, you know the change liquor and a life
like his make in a man."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course," muttered Bowdon.</p>

"SOMEBODY'LL BE GLAD TO SEE ME ANYHOW," HE ENDED WITH A LAUGH
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
"Thank heaven we've saved her from seeing him as
he is now!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that too." Bowdon rose and flung the
window open more widely. "Tell you what, Ashley,"
he said, "it seems to me the room stinks."</p>

<p>Ashley made no answer; he smiled, but not in mirth.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. Ashley went to open
it. Jack Fenning was there.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, Mr. Mead," he said, "but if you'll
give me a sheet of paper, I'll write for the passage; and
I may have to pay something extra for going back by
this boat."</p>

<p>"I'll look after that. Here's paper." And he
hustled Mr. Fenning out.</p>

<p>At the moment a tread became audible on the stairs.
Ashley stood where he was. "Somebody coming," he
said to Bowdon. "Hope he won't catch Fenning!"
Then came voices. The two men listened; the door
was good thick oak, and the voices were dim. "I know
that voice," said Ashley. "Who the deuce is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a man, anyhow," said Bowdon. He had entertained
a wild fear that the visitor might be Ora herself;
the scheme of things had a way of playing tricks
such as that.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye," said the voice, not Jack Fenning's.
They heard Jack going upstairs; at the same moment
came the shutting of his door and a knock at Ashley's.
With a glance at Bowdon, warning him to be discreet,
Ashley opened it. Mr. Sidney Hazlewood stood on the
threshold.</p>

<p>"Glad to find you in," he said, entering. "How are
you, Bowdon? I want your advice, Mead. Somebody's
stealing a piece of mine and I thought you'd be able to
tell me what to do. You're a lawyer, you see."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, in my spare time," said Ashley. "Sit down."</p>

<p>Hazlewood sat and began to take off his gloves.</p>

<p>"You've got a queer neighbour upstairs, that fellow
Foster," he said. "He told me he'd made your
acquaintance too."</p>

<p>"He's only here for a day or two, and I had to be
civil."</p>

<p>"Funny my meeting him. I used to come across
him in the States. Don't you be too civil."</p>

<p>"I know he's no great catch," said Ashley.</p>

<p>"He lived by his wits out there, and very badly at
that. In fact he'd have gone under altogether if he'd
been left to himself."</p>

<p>Ashley felt that Bowdon's eyes were on him, but
Bowdon took no share in the talk.</p>

<p>"Who looked after him then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"His wife," said Hazlewood. "She used to walk on,
or get a small part, or sing at the low-class halls, or
anything you like. Handsome girl in a coarse style.
Daisy Macpherson, that's what they called her. She
kept him more or less going; he always did what she
told him." He paused, and added with a reflective
smile, "I mean she said she was his wife, and liked to
be called Mrs. Foster in private life."</p>

<p>This time neither Bowdon nor Ashley spoke. Hazlewood
glanced at them and seemed to be struck with the
idea that they were not much interested in Foster and
the lady who was, or said she was, his wife.</p>

<p>"But I didn't come to talk about that," he went on
rather apologetically. "Only it was odd my meeting
the fellow."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Ashley carelessly. "What's
the play, Hazlewood, and who's the thief?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a><span>CHAPTER XVI</span>
<span class="smaller">MORALITY SMILES</span></h2>


<p>For Ora Pinsent the clouds were scattered, the
heavens were bright again, the sun shone. The
dread which had grown so acute was removed, the necessity
for losing what had come to be so much to her
had passed away. And all this had fallen to her without
blame, without calling for abasement or self-reproach.
Nay, in the end, on a view of the whole case,
she was meritorious. She had summoned her husband
back; true, at the last moment she had run away from
him and shirked her great scenes; but if he had really
come (she told herself now) she would have conquered
that momentarily uncontrollable impulse and done her
duty. After a few days' quiet in the country she would
have gained strength and resolution to carry out her
programme of renunciation and reformation. But he
had not come and now he would not come; not even a
message came. He refused to be reformed; there was
no need for anybody to be renounced. She had done
the right thing and by marvellous good fortune had escaped
all the disagreeable incidents which usually attend
on correct conduct. None could blame her; and
she herself could rejoice. She had offered her husband
his due; yet there was nothing to separate her from
Ashley or to break the sweet companionship. At last
fate had shewn her a little kindness; the world unbent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span>
towards her with a smile, and she, swiftly responsive,
held out both her hands to it in welcome for its new
benevolence. Trouble was over, the account was
closed; she was even as she had been before the hateful
letter came from Bridgeport, Connecticut. In very
truth now she could hide the letter among the roses and
let it lie there forgotten; the realities had fallen into line
with the symbols. As for the people who were to have
been edified by the reformation and comforted by the
renunciation, why, Irene and Alice Muddock had both
been so inexplicably harsh and unkind and unsympathetic
that Ora did not feel bound to make herself miserable
on their account. Irene had got her husband,
Alice did not deserve the man whom Ora understood
her to want. It happened that she herself was made
for Ashley and Ashley for her; you could not alter
these things; there they were. She lay back on the
sofa with her eyes on the portrait in the silver frame,
and declared that she was happier than she had been
for years. If only Ashley would come! For she was
rather hurt at Ashley's conduct. Here was Thursday
morning and he had not been to see her. He had written
very pretty notes, pleading pressing engagements,
but he had not come. She was a little vexed, but not
uneasy; no doubt he had been busy. She would, of
course, have excused him altogether had she known
that it was only on Wednesday evening that he was free
from his burden and back in town, after seeing his passenger
safely embarked on the boat which was to carry
him and his thousand pounds back to Bridgeport,
Connecticut, or somewhere equally far from the town
where she was.</p>

<p>Although Ashley did not come, she had a visitor, and
although the visitor was Babba Flint, he came not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>
merely in curiosity. His primary business was connected
with a play. He had the handling (such was
his expression) of a masterpiece; the heroine's part
was made for Ora, the piece would do great things
here, but, Babba asserted, even greater in America.
The author wanted Ora to play in it&mdash;authors have
these whims&mdash;and, if she consented, would offer his
work to Mr. Hazlewood; but Hazlewood without Ora
would not serve the turn.</p>

<p>"So I ran round to nobble you," said Babba.
"You know Sidney wants to go to the States, if he can
get plays. Well, mine (he had not actually written it)
is a scorcher."</p>

<p>"Should I have to go to America?" asked Ora
apprehensively.</p>

<p>"It's absurd you haven't been before." He proceeded
to describe Ora's American triumph and the
stream of gold which would flow in. "You take a
share," he said. "I can offer you a share. Sidney
would rather have you on a salary, but take my advice
and have a share."</p>

<p>The conversation became financial and Ora grew apparently
greedy. As Alice Muddock had noticed, she
had the art of seeming quite grasping and calculating.
But about going to America she gave no answer. The
matter was not urgent; the thing would not become
pressing for months. On being cross-questioned Babba
admitted that the masterpiece was not yet written; the
idea was there and had been confided to Babba; he
was thunderstruck with it and advised an immediate
payment of two hundred pounds. Then the masterpiece
would get itself written; all wheels must be oiled
if they are to run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>"And if you take half, you'll make a fortune," said
Babba.</p>

<p>Making a fortune for a hundred pounds was the kind
of operation which attracted Ora.</p>

<p>"I'll write you a cheque now," she said.</p>

<p>Babba smiled in a superior manner.</p>

<p>"There isn't all that hurry, as long as you're on," he
observed. "Won't you give me a kiss for putting you
on?"</p>

<p>"If it goes as you say, I'll give you a kiss&mdash;a kiss
for every thousand I make," said Ora, laughing.</p>

<p>"There won't be any of me left," groaned Babba,
with a humorous assumption of apprehension. He
paused for a moment, glanced at her out of the corner
of his eye, and added, "But what would Mr. Fenning
say?"</p>

<p>Ora sat on her sofa and regarded him. She said
nothing; she was trying to look grave, resentful, dignified&mdash;just
as Alice Muddock would look; she knew so
well how vulgar Babba was and how impertinent. Alas
that he amused her! Alas that just now anybody could
amuse and delight her! Her lips narrowly preserved
their severity, but her eyes were smiling. Babba, having
taken a survey of her, fell into an appearance of
sympathetic dejection.</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry he didn't come!" he murmured; "I
say, don't mind me if you want to cry."</p>

<p>"You're really atrocious," said Ora, and began to
laugh. "Nobody but you would dare," she went on.</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe in him all right, you know," said
Babba, "because I've seen him. But most people
don't, you know. I say, Miss Pinsent, it'd have a
good effect if you advertised; look <i>bonâ fide</i>, you know."</p>

<p>"You mustn't talk about it, really you mustn't," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span>
Ora, with twitching lips. It was all wrong (Oh, what
would Alice Muddock say?), but she was very much
amused. If her tragedy of renunciation would turn to
a comedy, she must laugh at the comedy.</p>

<p>"Keep it up," said Babba, with a grave and sincere
air of encouragement. "Postpone him, don't give him
up. Let him be coming in three months. It keeps us
all interested, you know. And if you positively can't
do anything else with him, divorce him."</p>

<p>Ora's eyes turned suddenly away.</p>

<p>"Anyhow don't waste him," Babba exhorted her.
"I tell you there's money in him."</p>

<p>"Now you must stop," she said with a new note of
earnestness. It caught Babba's attention.</p>

<p>"Kick me, if you like," said he. "I didn't know
you minded, though."</p>

<p>"I don't think I did, much," said Ora. Then she sat
up straight and looked past Babba with an absent air.
She had an idea of asking him what he thought of her
in his heart. He was shrewd under his absurdities,
kind under his vulgarity; he had never made love to
her; in passing she wondered why. But after all nobody
thought Babba's opinion worth anything.</p>

<p>"Do you remember meeting Miss Muddock here?"
she enquired.</p>

<p>"Rather," said Babba. "I know her very well. Now
she's a good sort&mdash;reminds you of your mother grown
young."</p>

<p>"Well, she thought you detestable," said Ora. The
praise of Alice was not grateful to her, although she
acknowledged the aptness of Babba's phrase.</p>

<p>"Yes, she would," said he cheerfully. "I've got to
shoulder that, you know. So have we all, if it comes
to that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>"We all! What do you mean?" Ora did not seem
amused now.</p>

<p>"Oh, our sort," said Babba. "I'll leave you out, if
you particularly wish it."</p>

<p>"Just tell me what you mean."</p>

<p>"Can't, for the life of me," said Babba. "Have a
cigarette?" He held out his case; Ora took a cigarette.
They both began to smoke. "But we give her
fits," he went on in a meditative tone, as of a man who
recognised facts, although he disclaimed all power of
explaining them. "I tell you what, though&mdash;" he resumed;
but again he paused.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Ora irritably.</p>

<p>"That's the sort to marry," said Babba, and put his
cigarette in his mouth with a final air.</p>

<p>"Ask her, then," said Ora, with an uncomfortable
laugh.</p>

<p>"I think I see myself!" smiled Babba. "How should
we mix?"</p>

<p>Ora rose from the sofa and walked restlessly to the
window. Her satisfaction with the world was shadowed.
She decided to tell Babba nothing of what Alice Muddock,
nothing of what Irene Kilnorton, had said to her.
For, strange as it seemed, Babba would understand, not
ridicule, appreciate, not deride, be nearer endorsing than
resenting. He would not see narrow, ignorant, uncharitable
prejudice; it appeared that he would recognise
some natural inevitable difference, having its outcome
in disapproval and aloofness. Was there this gulf?
Was Babba right in sitting down resignedly on the
other side of it? Her thoughts flew off to Ashley Mead.
On which side of the gulf was he? And if on the other
than that occupied by "our sort," would he cross the
gulf? How would he cross it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>"Well, you'll bear the matter of the play in mind,"
said Babba, rising and flinging away his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother me about plays now," cried Ora
impatiently.</p>

<p>Babba stood hat in hand, regarding her critically.
He saw that she was disturbed; he did not perceive
why she should be. The change of mood was a vagary
to be put up with, not accounted for; there was need of
Mr. Hazlewood's philosophy. He fell back on raillery.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," he said. "He'll turn up some day."</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Ora, with a stamp of her foot. "Go
away."</p>

<p>"Not unpardoned?" implored Babba tragically. Ora
could not help laughing, as she stretched out her hand
in burlesque grandeur, and allowed him to kiss it.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, we'll see you through," he assured her as
he went out, casting a glance back at the slim still figure
in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>Partly because he had not come sooner, more from
the shadow left by this conversation, she received Ashley
Mead when he arrived in the afternoon with a distance
of manner and a petulance which she was not
wont to show towards him. She had now neither
thanks for his labours in going to meet Mr. Fenning
nor apologies for her desertion of him; she gave no
voice to the joy for freedom which possessed her.
Babba Flint had roused an uneasiness which demanded
new and ample evidence of her power, a fresh assurance
that she was everything to Ashley, a proof that
though she might be all those women said she was,
yet she was irresistible, conquering and to conquer.
And her triumph should not be won by borrowing
weapons or tactics from the enemy. She would win
with her own sword, in her own way, as herself; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span>
had rather exaggerate than soften what they blamed in
her; still she would achieve her proof and win her
battle.</p>

<p>There seemed indeed no battle to fight, for Ashley
was very tender and friendly to her; he appeared, however,
a little depressed. Pushing her experiment, she
began to talk about Irene and Alice, and, as she put it,
"that sort of woman."</p>

<p>"But they aren't at all the same sort of woman," he
objected, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they are, if you compare them with me,"
she insisted, pursuing the path which Babba's reflections
had shewn her.</p>

<p>"Well, they've certain common points as compared
with you, perhaps," he admitted.</p>

<p>"They're good and I'm not."</p>

<p>"You aren't alarmingly bad," said Ashley, looking at
her. He was wondering how she had come to marry
Fenning.</p>

<p>"Look at my life and theirs!"</p>

<p>"Very different, of course." They had never been
joined in bonds of union with Fenning.</p>

<p>She leant forward and began to finger the flowers in
her vase.</p>

<p>"It would have been better," she said, "if Jack had
come. Then you could have gone back. I know you
think you're bound not to go back now."</p>

<p>He took no notice of her last words, and asked no
explanation of what "going back" meant.</p>

<p>"I'd sooner see you dead than with your husband,"
he said quietly.</p>

<p>Forgetting the flowers, she bent forward with clasped
hands. "Would you, Ashley?" she whispered. The
calm gravity of his speech was sweet incense to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[Pg 235]</span>
Speaking like that, he surely meant what he said!
"How could you help me to bring him back, then?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't quite realised the sort of man he must be."</p>

<p>"Oh!" This was not just what she wanted to hear.
"There's nothing particular the matter with him," she
said.</p>

<p>"The things you told me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I daresay I was unjust. I expect I exasperated him
terribly. I used rather to like him&mdash;really, you know."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't now," said Ashley with a frown. The
remark seemed to shew too much knowledge. He
added, "I mean, would you?"</p>

<p>"Now? Oh, now&mdash;things are different. I should
hate it now." She rose and stood opposite to him.
"What's the matter?" she asked. "You're not happy
to-day. Is anything wrong?"</p>

<p>He could not tell her what was wrong, how this man
whom she had so unaccountably brought into her life
seemed first to have degraded her and now to degrade
him. To tell her that was to disclose all the story. He
could throw off neither his disgust with himself nor his
discontent with her. She had not asked him to borrow
money and bribe Jack Fenning to go away; it was by
no will of hers that he had become a party to the sordid
little drama which Hazlewood's information enabled him
to piece together. All she saw was that he was gloomy
and that he did not make love to her. He should have
come in a triumph of exultation that their companionship
need not be broken. Her fears were ready with an
explanation. Was Babba Flint right? Was the companionship
unnatural, incapable of lasting, bound to be
broken? She looked down on him, anger and entreaty
fighting in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I believe you're sorry he didn't come," she said, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[Pg 236]</span>
a low voice. "Do you want to get rid of me? You've
only to say so, if that's what you want."</p>

<p>"I'm not sorry he didn't come," said Ashley, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Now you're amused. What at?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the way things happen! Among all the things
I thought you might say to me, I never thought of your
telling me that I was sorry he hadn't come." He
raised his eyes to hers suddenly. "Do you know anything
about what he does out there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; he never wrote, except that once. I don't want
to know; it doesn't matter to me."</p>

<p>"One letter in five years&mdash;isn't it five?&mdash;isn't
much."</p>

<p>"Oh, why should he write? We separated for ever."</p>

<p>"But then he proposed to come."</p>

<p>"Dear me, don't be logical, Ashley. You see he
didn't come. I suppose he had a fit of something
and wrote then." She paused, and added with a
smile, "Perhaps it occurred to him that I used to be
attractive."</p>

<p>"And then he forgot again?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Why do you talk about him? He's
gone!" She waved her hand as though to scatter the
last mist of remembrance of Jack Fenning.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he wanted to get some money out of you,"
said Ashley.</p>

<p>"You aren't flattering, Ashley."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear, a man who does what I do may say
what I say."</p>

<p>Something in his words or tone appealed to her.
She knelt down by his chair and looked up in his face.</p>

<p>"You do all sorts of things for me, don't you?"</p>

<p>"All sorts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>"And you hate a good many of them?"</p>

<p>"Some."</p>

<p>"And your friends hate all of them for your sake!
I mean Irene, and Miss Muddock, and so on. Ashley,
would you do anything really bad for me?"</p>

<p>"I expect so."</p>

<p>"I don't care; I should like it. And when you'd
done it I should like to go and tell Alice Muddock all
about it."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't care." His voice sounded sincere,
not merely as though it gave utterance to the proper
formal disclaimer of an unloved lady's interest in him.
Ora did not miss the ring of truth.</p>

<p>"Has she begun not to care?" she asked.</p>

<p>"If you choose to put it in that way, yes," he answered,
with a shrug of his shoulders. "You see, we
go different ways."</p>

<p>The talk seemed all of different ways and different
sorts to-day.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," she answered, drawing a little back
from him, but not rising from her knees. Ashley was
not looking at her, but, resting his head on his hands,
gazed straight in front of him; he was frowning again.
"What are they saying about Jack not coming?" she
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"What they would," said Ashley, without turning
his head. "You know; I needn't tell you."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know. Well, what does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Not a ha'penny," said Ashley Mead. It was not
what they said that troubled him; what they said had
nothing to do with what he had done.</p>

<p>"Ashley," she said, with an imperative note in her
voice, "I know exactly what I ought to do; I've read
it in a lot of books." Her smile broke out for a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span>
"Most books are stupid&mdash;at least the women
in them are. I was stupid before&mdash;before Jack didn't
come, and I thought I'd do it. Well, I won't. I don't
believe you'd be happier. I won't give you up, I won't
let you go."</p>

<p>Ashley turned on her with a smile.</p>

<p>"Nothing equals the conceit of women," he said.
"They always think they can settle the thing. Whatever
you say, I've not the least intention of being given
up." It crossed his mind that to allow himself to be
given up now would be a remarkable piece of ineptitude,
when he had sacrificed a thousand pounds, and
one or two other things, in order to free himself and her
from the necessity of their renunciation.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you go if I told you?"</p>

<p>"Not I!"</p>

<p>"Well then, I've half a mind to tell you!" Her tone
was gay; Babba Flint's inexplicable convictions and
voiceless philosophy were forgotten. The man she
loved loved her; what more was there to ask? She
began to wonder how she had strayed from this simple
and satisfactory point of view; didn't it exhaust the
world? It was not hers to take thought for him, but to
render herself into his hands. Not ashamed of this
weakness, still she failed to discern that in it lay her
overwhelming strength. She stretched out her hands
and put them in his with her old air of ample self-surrender,
of a capitulation that was without condition
because the conqueror's generosity was known of all.
"What are we worrying about?" she cried with a low
merry laugh. "Here are you, Ashley, and here am I!"
And now she recollected no more that this kind of
conduct was exactly what seemed horrible to Alice
Muddock and wantonly wicked to Irene Kilnorton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[Pg 239]</span>
In this mood her fascination was strongest; she had the
power of making others forget what she forgot. Ashley
Mead sat silent, looking at her, well content if he might
have rested thus for an indefinite time, with no need of
calculating, of deciding, or of acting. As for her, so for
him now, it was enough. With a light laugh she drew
her hands away and sprang to her feet. "I wish I
hadn't got to go to the theatre," she exclaimed.
"We'd dine somewhere together. Oh, of course you're
engaged, but of course you'd break it. You'd just
wire, 'Going to dine with Ora Pinsent,' and they'd all
understand. They couldn't expect you to refuse that
for any engagement; you see, they know you're rather
fond of me. Besides they'd all do just the same themselves,
if they had the chance." So she gave rein to
her vanity and her triumph; they could not but please
him since they were her pæan over his love for her.</p>

<p>Till the last possible moment he stayed with her, driving
with her to the theatre again as in the days when
the near prospect of the renunciation made indiscretion
provisional and unimportant. He would not see her
act; it was being alone with her, having her to himself,
which was so sweet that he could hardly bring himself
to surrender it. To see her as one of a crowd had not
the virtue that being alone with her had; it brought
back, instead of banishing, what she had made him
forget&mdash;the view of the world, what she was to others,
and what she was to himself so soon as the charm of
her presence was removed. He left her at the door of
the theatre and went off to keep his dinner engagement.
With her went the shield that protected him from reflexion
and saved him from summing up the facts of the
situation.</p>

<p>Morality has curious and unexpected ways of justifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[Pg 240]</span>
itself, even that somewhat specialised form of
morality which may be called the code of worldly
honour. This was Ashley Mead's first reflexion. A
very stern character is generally imputed to morality;
people hardly do justice nowadays to its sense of
humour; they understood that better in the old days.
"The Lord shall have them in derision." Morality is
fond of its laugh. Here was his second thought, which
came while a vivacious young lady gave him her
opinion of the last popular philosophical treatise. To
take advantage of Mr. Hazlewood's carelessly dropped
information, to follow up the clue of the good-for-nothing
Foster and the masterful Daisy Macpherson, to
set spies afoot, to trace the local habitation of the
"little spec," and to find out who formed the establishment
that carried it on&mdash;all this would be no doubt
possible, and seemed in itself sordid enough, with its
sequel of a divorce suit, and the notoriety of the proceedings
which Miss Pinsent's fame would ensure. Yet
all this might possibly have been endured with set teeth
and ultimately lived down, if only it had chanced that
Mr. Hazlewood had been to hand with his very significant
reminiscences before Lord Bowdon and Ashley
Mead had made up their minds that Jack Fenning must
be got out of the way, and that a thousand pounds
should buy his departure and bribe him not to obtrude
his society upon the lady who was his wife. That Mr.
Hazlewood came after the arrangement was made and
after the bargain struck was the satiric touch by which
morality lightened its grave task of business-like retribution.
What, if any, might be the legal effect of such
a transaction in the eyes of the tribunal to which Miss
Pinsent must be persuaded to appeal, Ashley did not
pretend to know and could not bring himself seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span>
to care. The impression which it would create on the
world when fully set forth (and he knew Jack Fenning
too well to suppose that it would not be declared if it
suited that gentleman's interest) was only too plain. The
world perhaps might not understand Bowdon's part in
the affair; probably it would content itself with surmises
about something lying in the past and with accompanying
sympathetic references to poor Irene Kilnorton; but
its judgment of himself, of Jack Fenning, and of Ora
Pinsent was not doubtful. Would the world believe that
Ora knew nothing about the manner of Jack's coming
and the manner of Jack's going? The world was not
born yesterday! And about Ashley Mead the world
would, after a perfunctory pretence of seeking a charitable
explanation, confess itself really unable to come to
any other than one conclusion. The world would say
that the whole thing was very deplorable but would not
attempt to discriminate between the parties. "Six of
one and half-a-dozen of the other." That would be the
world's verdict, and, having arrived at it, it would await
the infinitely less important judgment of the Court with
a quiet determination not to be shaken in its view of the
case.</p>

<p>To pursue a path that ended thus was to incur penalties
more degrading and necessities more repugnant
than could lie in an open defiance of this same world
with its sounding censures and malicious smiles. To
defy was in a way respectable; this would be to grovel,
and to grovel with no better chance than that of receiving
at last a most contemptuous pardon. "Six of one
and half-a-dozen of the other." He would be paired
off with Jack Fenning, Ora coupled with the masterful
Daisy Macpherson. Let them fight it out among themselves&mdash;while
decent people stood aloof with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[Pg 242]</span>
noses in the air, their ears open, and their lips as grave
as might be. Such was the offer of peace which morality,
certainly not serious beyond suspicion, made to Ashley
Mead; if he would submit to this, his offence touching
that matter of the thousand pounds and the burking of
Mr. Fenning's visit should be forgotten. Better war to
the death, thought Ashley Mead.</p>

<p>But what would Bowdon say? And what would be
the cry that echoed in the depths of Ora's eyes?</p>

<p>He asked the question as he looked at her picture.
Suddenly with an oath he turned away; there had come
into his mind the recollection of Jack Fenning's ardent
study of Miss Macpherson's face.</p>

<p><i>Mutato nomine de te</i>:&mdash;and does the name make such
a difference?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a><span>CHAPTER XVII</span>
<span class="smaller">AT SEA AND IN PORT</span></h2>


<p>To Irene Kilnorton, occupied with the matter
against her will and in face of self-contempt,
the non-appearance of Jack Fenning was a source of
renewed irritation and uneasiness. She could not smile
with the world nor agree to dispose of the subject with
the cynical and contented observation that she had
never supposed the man would come and had her
doubts about there being such a man at all. Her consideration
of it was bound to be more elaborate, her
view more individual. Hence came the self-contempt
and anger which afflicted her without affecting facts.
For the present indeed Ora was infatuated with Ashley
Mead, a position of affairs deplorable on general grounds
but reassuring on personal; but then where was her
safety, what security had she? She let injustice trick
her into panic&mdash;with such as Ora the infatuation of
Monday afternoon might be followed by a new passion
on Tuesday morning. The mixture of jealousy with
her moral condemnation caused Irene to suffer an unhealthy
attraction to the subject; she could not help
talking about it; she talked about it with Bowdon to
his great discomfort. He was not a good dissembler;
he could respect a secret, but his manner was apt to
betray that there was a secret; he was restless, impatient,
now and then almost rude, when Irene harped on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[Pg 244]</span>
string of Jack Fenning's strange behaviour. Or was it
not Ora's? Had Ora at the last moment, for reasons
unquestionably sufficient, countermanded her husband?
Bowdon was pathetic in his plea of ignorance, but the
plea did not ring true. Thus she was sore with her
<i>fiancé</i>, vexed with Ashley Mead, and furious against
Ora Pinsent. Yet, being a woman of the world, she
was polite to Ora when they met, friendly if severe to
Ashley, and, as has been said, interested in both of them
with a reluctant intensity.</p>

<p>Any strangeness there might be in her own attitude
was suggested to her for the first time by the very different
behaviour of her friend Alice Muddock. Here
she found a definiteness of mind, a resolution, and a relentlessness
which she hardly knew whether to laugh at,
to shudder at, or to admire. She knew what Ashley
had been to Alice; she remembered how in the beginning
Alice had taken a liking to Ora Pinsent. Yet now
her own anger could hardly seem deep or serious beside
Alice's silent condemnation; her moral disapproval,
with its copious discussion and its lively interest, was
mere frippery compared with her friend's eloquent ignoring
of the very existence of the culprits. Having
dropped in to talk the whole thing over, Irene was
amazed to find that she was ashamed to introduce the
subject. "I suppose I'm not really moral at all,"
thought Irene with a moment's insight into the radical
differences between her friend and herself, between the
talkative shockedness of society and the genuine
grieved concern which finds in silence its only possible
expression. "And I brought Ora here!" Irene reflected
in mingled awe and amusement; her deed
seemed now like throwing a lighted squib into a
chapelfull of worshippers. "It's a little bit absurd,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span>
was suggested by her usual way of looking at things.
"Quite proper, though," added her jealousy of Ora
Pinsent. But the habitual had the last word with her.
"I suppose the Muddocks were brought up in that
way," she ended.</p>

<p>Alice had been brought up in that way; from that
way she had struggled to escape with the help of some
uncertain intellectual lights; but the lights had drawn
their flickering radiance from the flame of her love for
Ashley Mead. So long as she could she had believed
the best, or had at least refused to believe the worst.
But the lights did not now burn brightly, their oil gave
out, and the prejudices (if they were prejudices) began
to gather round, thick and darkening. A lax judgment
on a matter of morals seldom survives defeat suffered
at the hands of the sinner. This fortuitous buttressing
of righteousness is all to the good. Yet because she
did not see how her own feelings joined forces with her
idea of right, how the fact of the argosy being laden
with her own hopes intensified in her eyes the crime of
the pirate, Alice Muddock became hard to the sinners
as well as justly severe on their censurable doings; and,
from having once tried to understand and excuse them,
grew more certain that they could put forward no mitigating
plea. Weeks passed and Ashley Mead was not
asked to Kensington Palace Gardens.</p>

<p>"It's a little inhuman; she was fond of him," thought
Irene. Then came a flash of light. "Bertie Jewett!"
she cried inwardly, and her lips set in the stoniness of a
new disapproval. Much as Bertie had conciliated her,
the reaction went too far for Lady Kilnorton's taste.
It is very well to be estimable, but it is very ill to be
estimable and nothing else; and she thought that Bertie
was nothing else, unless it were that he was also a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[Pg 246]</span>
vulgar; to Bowdon she had denied this; to herself she
admitted it.</p>

<p>Yet she was very wrong. He might be vulgar; he
was estimable; but he was much besides; hence it
happened that the thing which seemed to her so impossible
was in a fair way to come about. Old Sir
James was dying, and stayed his last tottering steps on
Bertie Jewett's arm; Bob came home day by day to tell
how all the business hung on Bertie Jewett; Bob's echo,
Lady Muddock, was of course in the same cry; the
potent influence of the household, which so encircles
the individual, ringed Alice round with the praises of
Bertie Jewett. She had no passion for him, but now it
seemed to her that passions were of doubtful advantage
and that she at least was not meant for them; the idea
of having one had been part of her great mistake.
Bertie lay right on the true lines of her life, as training
and fate&mdash;as God, she said to herself&mdash;had planned
them for her; if she followed them, would she not come
to Bertie? All this was much, yet not enough had he
been only estimable. He was strong also, strong to
advance and strong to wait; the keenness of his pale
blue eyes saved him here as it saved him in the bargains
that he made. It shewed him his hour and the plan of
his attack. With cautious audacity he laid his siege,
letting his deeds not his words speak for him, trusting
not to his words but to his deeds to disparage his
rival. The man had the instinct for success&mdash;or
seemed to have it, because his desires and capabilities
were so nicely adjusted and of such equal range. He
could not have written a poem, but he never wanted to.
Ora Pinsent would have suffered under him as under a
long church service; but then he would never have
tried to please that lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>"Do you really like him?" Irene asked Alice as they
walked in the garden.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Alice thoughtfully. "I really like him
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, because he's helpful and handy, and looks after
you all!"</p>

<p>"No, there's something more than that." She
frowned a little. "You can rely on him; I don't mean
to do things so much as to be things&mdash;the things you
expect, you know. I think the one terrible thing would
be to have to do with a person who was all fits and
starts; it would seem as though there was no real person
there at all."</p>

<p>"That's what I always feel about Ora Pinsent." Irene
took courage and introduced the name deliberately.</p>

<p>"Yes," Alice assented briefly. Irene had no doubt
that she was thinking of Miss Pinsent's friend also, and
when she came to report the conversation to Bowdon
this aspect of it took the foremost place.</p>

<p>"If she marries Mr. Jewett," said Irene, "it'll be just
in a recoil from Ashley Mead."</p>

<p>Bowdon did not look at her but at the end of the
cigarette which he was smoking by the window in
Queen's Gate. He had no difficulty in understanding
how a recoil might land one in a marriage; this was to
him trodden ground.</p>

<p>"She'll be happier with him," Irene continued. "Ora
has quite spoilt Ashley for any other woman."</p>

<p>Bowdon agreed that Miss Pinsent might very likely
have some such effect, but he expressed the view quite
carelessly.</p>

<p>"Besides, really, how could any self-respecting woman
think of him now, any more than any man could of
her?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>Bowdon made no answer to this question, which was,
after all, purely rhetorical.</p>

<p>"But, hang it, Jewett!" he remarked after a pause.</p>

<p>"I know," said Irene, forgetting her former dialectical
championship of Bertie. The matter was serious
now. "She needn't have taken quite such an extreme
remedy; but he was on the spot, you see; and&mdash;and
it's the business. She's falling right back into the
business, over head and ears and all. It's rather sad,
but&mdash;" It seemed as though she meant that it was
better than linking fortunes with a being all fits and
starts. She rose and came near him. "I think we're
just about right, you and I, Frank," she said. "We
aren't Jewetts and we aren't Oras. I think we're the
happy compromise."</p>

<p>"You are, no doubt, my dear. I'm a dull dog," said
Bowdon.</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment and turned away with
a little sigh. The marriage was very near; was the work
yet fully done, or had fits and starts still their power over
him and their attraction for him? He made a remark
the next moment which vexed her intensely.</p>

<p>"Well, you know," he said with a thoughtful smile,
"I expect we seem to Miss Pinsent just what Jewett
seems to us."</p>

<p>Irene walked away and sat down in a chair on the
other side of the room.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't care what I seem to Ora Pinsent,"
she said very coldly; but Bowdon smoked on in pensive
silence.</p>

<p>At this time both the triumph and the activity of
Babba Flint were great. He was divided between the
masterpiece of dramatic writing at whose birth he was
assisting, and the masterpiece of prescience which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[Pg 249]</span>
had himself displayed touching the matter of Mr.
Fenning's return. When he contemplated these two
achievements (and he took almost as much personal
credit for the first as for the second) he said openly
that he ought to find excuse for being "a bit above
himself." It was no use to tell him that he was not
writing the play, and neither of the men who knew
chose to tell him that he had been wrong in regard to
Jack Fenning. Thus left to a blessed self-conceit, he
obtruded on Ashley Mead certain advice which was
received with a curious bitter amusement.</p>

<p>"If I were you, I'd find out something about the
fellow," he said. "I mean&mdash;why didn't he come?"
He looked very sly. "<i>Cherchez la femme</i>," he added.</p>

<p>"And if I found her?" asked Ashley.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you know best about that," said Babba.
He conceded that it was entirely for Ashley to say
whether he would greet a chance of establishing his
relations with Ora on a regular and respectable basis.
"But, depend on it, she's there," he added, waving his
hand in the supposed direction of the United States.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder at all," Ashley remarked, his
recollection fixed on Miss Macpherson's portrait.</p>

<p>"Now if we all go over in the winter&mdash;" began
Babba.</p>

<p>"You all? Who do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, if we take the play. Have I told you
about&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, yes, Babba, twenty times. But I'd forgotten."</p>

<p>"Well, if Hazlewood and Miss Pinsent and I go&mdash;we
can't ask you, I'm afraid, you know&mdash;we can nose
about a bit."</p>

<p>Ashley looked at him with a helpless smile; the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span>
conjured up by his expression lacked no repulsive
feature. Here was a hideously apt summary of the
prospect which had been in his own thoughts; if he
followed the clue, he must nose about or get somebody
to nose about for him.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Babba," he commanded, rudely enough;
but Babba smiled and told him to think it over. Babba
did not recognise any defect in the manner of offering
his services or anything objectionable in the substance
of them. He had flung open a door; he could not be
expected to guarantee the cleanliness of the threshold,
since he had not a very fine eye with which to guide
the broom.</p>

<p>Whatever Ashley might think about the opportunities
supposed to be afforded by the suggested
excursion to America, he could not avoid giving consideration
to the tour itself. The London season drew
to a close; Mr. Hazlewood wanted to make his plans;
Babba and his associates were urgent for a Yes or a No.
If Ora said Yes, after a brief rest she would set to work
at rehearsals and in a few weeks cross the seas; if she
said No, she had the prospect of a long holiday, to be
spent how she would, where she would, with whom
she would. This position of affairs raised the great
question in a concrete and urgent form; it pressed
itself on Ashley Mead; he began to wonder when it
would make an impression on Ora. For up to the
present time she did not seem to have looked ahead;
she had fallen back into the state of irresponsible
happiness from which her husband's letter had roused
her. She considered the tour with interest and even
eagerness, but without bringing it into relation with
Ashley Mead; in other moments she talked rapturously
about the delights of a holiday, but either ignored or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span>
tacitly presupposed the manner and the company in
which she was to spend it. She never referred to her
husband; she had, and apparently expected to have,
no letter from him. He was gone; Ora seemed as
unconscious of the problem to which his disappearance
gave rise as she was ignorant of the means by which
the disappearance had been brought about. She had
left to Ashley the decision as to whether she should or
should not undertake the renunciation and reformation;
so she appeared to leave it to him now to make up
his mind what must be done since the reformation had
become impossible and the renunciation of no effect.
Meanwhile she was delightfully happy.</p>

<p>It was this unmeditated joy in her which made it at
once impossible for Ashley to leave her and impossible
to shape plans by which he should be enabled to stay
with her. To do either was to spoil what he had, was
to soil a simple perfection, was to run up against the
world, against the world's severe cold Alice Muddocks
with their scorn of emotions, and its Babba Flints with
their intolerable man&oelig;uvres and hints of profitable
nosings. That a choice of courses should be forced
on him became irksome. Things were very well as
they were; she was happy, he was happy, Jack Fenning
was gone, and&mdash;well, some day he would pay Lord
Bowdon a thousand pounds.</p>

<p>He was in this mood when the American tour faced
him with its peremptory summons, with its business-like
calculations of profit, its romantic involving of
despair, its abominable possibilities of nosing. Babba
spoke of it to him, so did Mr. Hazlewood, both with an
air of curiosity; Ora herself speculated about it more
and more, sometimes in her artistic, sometimes in her
financial, sometimes in her fatalistic mood. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span>
strange about it; now she would talk as though he
were to be with her, again as if he were to be at work
here at home and his letters her only comfort. She
never faced facts; she did not even look at them from
the corner of an eye, over the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Shall I go or not?" she would ask him, as though it
were a question between keeping some trivial engagement
and breaking it for a pleasanter. "Now, shall I
go, Ashley dear?"</p>

<p>Had she no notion of what things meant? Away
from her he often asked this question; when he was
with her, it died away on his lips. Then he declared
that, if he could so cheat necessity and beguile the
inevitable from its path, she should never know what
things meant, never take a hard reckoning with the
world, never be forced to assess herself. She had forgotten
what Irene and what Alice had said to her, or
had persuaded herself that they spoke for form's sake,
or in jealousy, or in ignorance, or because their clergyman
had such influence over them, or for some such
cause. She was now as simply unreasoning as she was
simply happy; she was altogether at his disposal, ready
to go or stay, to do what he ordered, even (as he knew)
to leave him in tears and sorrow, if that were his will.
She left it all to him; and, having it all left to him, he
left it to Mr. Hazlewood, to Babba Flint, or to any
other superficially inadequate embodiment in which the
Necessary chose to clothe itself.</p>

<p>But Bowdon's thousand pounds? Such a man as
Ashley&mdash;or as his creditor&mdash;will be careless of all
things in earth or heaven save a woman's secret, his
given word, the etiquette of his profession, and a debt
of honour. The thousand pounds was in the fullest
sense a debt of honour. He had not a thousand pounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[Pg 253]</span>
To save was impossible while Ora went everywhere with
him. Money to her was like manna and seemed to
entail the same obligation that none of the day's bounty
should be left to the next morning. Ashley was hard-up;
the prosaic fact shot across his mental embarrassments
in a humorous streak. He laughed at it, at
himself when he bought Ora bouquets or the last fancy
in blotting-pads, at her when she asked him for a sovereign,
because she had no place convenient for the carrying
of a purse. At a word she would have repaid, and
besides flung all she had into his hands. But that word
he would not speak. The Commission drew near to
its close; brief bred brief but slowly; and as long as he
owed Bowdon a thousand pounds he seemed to himself
more than criminal. But did he owe it? Yes, a thousand
times. For if he did not, then Bowdon was something
more to Ora Pinsent than a chance acquaintance
or a friend's <i>fiancé</i>. He acknowledged the hearty good
comradeship which had shewn itself in the loan; but it
had been a loan; only by repaying it could he appropriate
the service to himself and remove another's
offering from the shrine at which he worshipped.</p>

<p>Matters standing in this position, time, with its usual
disregard of the state of our private affairs, brought on
the wedding of Irene Kilnorton and Lord Bowdon.
Irene had found no sufficient reason for objecting to Ashley's
presence. Logic then demanded that an invitation
should be sent to Miss Pinsent. As it chanced, it
pleased Ora to come in conspicuous fashion, in a gown
which the papers were bound to notice, in a hat of
mark, rather late, full of exuberant sympathy with the
performance. She arrived only a minute before the
bride, while Bowdon and Ashley Mead stood side by
side close to the altar-rails. Both saw her the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[Pg 254]</span>
she came in, both looked at her, neither made any
comment on her appearance. As soon as the procession
entered she made an effort to relapse into decorous
obscurity, but, willy-nilly, she halved attention with
the proper heroine of the day. A wedding affected
Ora; the ready tears stood in her eyes as the solemn
confident vows were spoken. Ashley almost laughed
as he listened to Bowdon's; he had a sudden sense
that it would be rather absurd if Ora and he took such
vows; he had a distinct knowledge that the woman of
whom he himself thought was in the minds of bride and
bridegroom also. He glanced at her, she smiled at him
with her innocent disregard of appearances. He looked
the other way and found Alice Muddock with eyes firm
set on her prayer-book. The officiating minister delivered
a little discourse, one of his own writing, in lieu
of the homily. Looking again, Ashley found Alice's
eyes on the minister with a grave meditative gaze, as
though she weighed his words and assessed the duties
and the difficulties they set forth; but Ora was glancing
round the church, finding acquaintances. When the
ceremony ended and they had come out of the vestry,
he walked past Ora in the wake of the procession. Ora
smiled in a comprehending, rather compassionate way;
her emotion was quite gone. Now she seemed to bid
him take the ceremony for what it was worth. He had
watched to see whether Bowdon looked at her; Bowdon
had not looked. That was because the ceremony had
seemed of importance to him. Ashley broke into a
smile; it would have been more encouraging, if also
more commonplace, had Ora's tears not been so obviously
merely a tribute to the literary gifts of the composers
of the service.</p>

<p>At the reception afterwards&mdash;it was quiet and small&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[Pg 255]</span>
thing happened which seemed to have a queer
significance. He found Ora, and took her round the
rooms. As they made their circuit they came on Alice
Muddock; she was talking to Bertie Jewett. She
looked up, bowed to Ashley, and smiled; she took no
notice at all of Ora Pinsent. Ashley felt himself turn
red, and his lips shaped themselves into angry words;
he turned to Ora. Ora was looking the other way.
She had been cut; but she had not seen it; she had
not noticed Alice Muddock. But Ashley understood
that the two women had parted asunder, that to be
the friend of one was in future not to be a friend to the
other.</p>

<p>It was a queer moment also when Ora, full again of
overflowing emotions, flung herself on Irene's breast,
kissed her, blessed her, praised her, prayed for her,
laughed at her, lauded her gown, and told her that she
had never looked better in her life. Irene laughed and
returned the kiss; then she looked at her husband,
next at Ashley, lastly at Ora Pinsent. There was a
moment of silent embarrassment in all the three; Ora
glanced round at them and broke into her low laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, what have I done to you all?" she cried.
"Have I hypnotised you all?"</p>

<p>Bowdon raised his eyes, let them rest on her a
moment, then turned to Ashley Mead. The two women
began to talk again. For a moment the two men stood
looking at one another. They had their secret. Each
telegraphed to the other, "Not a word about the thousand!"
Then they shook hands heartily. Ora and
Ashley passed on. For a moment Bowdon looked after
them. Then he turned to his bride and found her eyes
on him. He took her hand and pressed it. Her eyes
were bright as she looked at him for an instant before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[Pg 256]</span>
a new friend claimed her notice. As she greeted the
friend, Bowdon gave a little sigh.</p>

<p>He was in port! But the laughing, dancing, buffeting,
dangerous waves are also sweet.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I went," said Ora, as Ashley handed her
into her victoria. She laughed as she lay back on the
cushions.</p>

<p>"It was so funny at my wedding," she said. "Jack
lost the ring." She waved her hand merrily as she was
driven away.</p>

<p>"Come soon," she cried over her shoulder.</p>

<p>He waved his hand in response and turned to go
back into the house. In his path stood Bertie Jewett.
For an instant Ashley stood still.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's about over," he said carelessly.</p>

<p>"Just about. I must get back to the shop," said
Bertie, looking at his watch. But he did not move.
Ashley, glancing beyond him, saw Alice Muddock
coming towards the door.</p>

<p>"So must I," he said, clapping on his hat and hailing
a hansom. He jumped in and was carried away.</p>

<p>One of Bowdon's servants brought his walking-stick
to his rooms the next day. He had forgotten it in a
passing recollection of old days, when Alice and he
used to laugh together over the man&oelig;uvres by which
they got rid of Bertie Jewett.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a><span>CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<span class="smaller">THE PLAY AND THE PART</span></h2>


<p>Babba Flint's dramatic masterpiece progressed and
took shape rapidly. "The beggar's got at it
at last," Babba said, in one of his infrequent references
to the author. Mr. Hazlewood did not talk much, but
was plainly of opinion that there might be a great deal
of money made. Ora was enthusiastic. She had seen
the scenario and had read the first draft of the great
scene in the third act. The author had declared his
conviction that no woman save Ora could play this
scene; Ora was certain that it would be intolerable to
her that any other woman should. She did not then
and there make up her mind to play it, but it began to
be certain that she would play it and would accept
such arrangements of her life and her time as made her
playing of it possible. In this way things, when suggested
or proposed, slid into actual facts with her;
they grew insensibly, as acquaintances grow; she found
herself committed to them without any conscious act of
decision. "Let her alone, she'll do it," said Hazlewood
to Babba, and Babba did no more than throw out,
on the one side, conjectures as to the talent which
certain ladies whom he named might display in the <i>rôle</i>,
and, on the other, forecasts of the sure triumph which
would await Ora herself. Finally he added that Ora
had better see the whole piece before she arrived at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[Pg 258]</span>
conclusion. Hazlewood approved and seconded these
indirect but skilful tactics. With every such discussion
the play and the part made their footing more and
more secure in Ora's mind. She began to talk as
though, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, she
would be "opening" in New York with the play and
the part in October; when she spoke thus to Ashley
Mead, the old look of vague questioning was in her
eyes; it seemed to him as though the old look of apprehension
or appeal were there also, as though she
were a little afraid that he would forbid her to go and
prevent her from playing the part. But in this look
lay the only reference that she made to her present
position, and her only admission that it held any difficulties.
His answer to it was to talk to her about the
play and the part; this he could not do without the
implied assumption that she would act the part in
the play, would act it with Sidney Hazlewood, and
would act it in America in October.</p>

<p>What these things that were gradually insinuating
themselves into the status of established facts meant to
him he began to see. For the play was nothing to
him, he had no share in the venture, and certainly he
could not tour about the United States of America as a
superfluous appendage to Mr. Hazlewood's theatrical
company. The result was that she would go away
from him, and that the interval before she went grew
short. Up to the present time there was no change in
their relations; as they had been before the coming and
going of Jack Fenning, they were still. But such relations
must in the end go forward or backward; had he
chosen, he knew that they would have gone forward;
more plainly than in words she had left that to him;
but he had left the decision to the course of events, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[Pg 259]</span>
that arbiter was deciding that the relations should go
backward. She loved him still, tenderly always, sometimes
passionately; but the phase of feeling in which
her love had been the only thing in the world for her
was passing away, as the counter-attraction of the play
and the part increased in strength. The rest of her
life, which love's lullaby had put to sleep, was awaking
again. In him a resignation mingled with the misery
brought by his recognition of this; unless he could
resort to the "nosings" which Babba Flint suggested,
he would lose her, she would drift away from him; he
felt deadened at the prospect but was not nerved to
resist it. He was paralysed by an underlying consciousness
that this process was inevitable; the look in
her eyes confirmed the feeling in him; now she seemed
to look at him, even while she caressed him, from across
a distance which lay between them. His encounter
with Bertie Jewett after the wedding had been the incident
which made him understand how he had passed
out of Alice Muddock's life, and she out of his, his
place in hers being filled by another, hers in his left
empty. The fatalism of his resignation accepted a like
ending for himself and Ora Pinsent. Presently she
would be gone; there was no use in trying to weld into
one lives irrevocably disassociated by the tendency of
things. This was the conclusion which forced itself
upon him, when he perceived that she would certainly
act in the play and certainly go to America in the
autumn.</p>

<p>The mists of love conceal life's landscape, wrapping
all its features in a glowing haze. Presently the soft
clouds lift, and little by little the scene comes back
again; once more the old long roads stretch out, the
quiet valleys spread, the peaks raise their heads; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[Pg 260]</span>
traveller shoulders his knapsack and starts again on his
path. He has lingered; here now are the roads to
traverse and the peaks to climb; here is reality; where
is that which was the sole reality? But at first the way
seems very long, the sack is very heavy, and the peaks&mdash;are
they worth the climbing?</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Ashley? You're glum," she
said one day, after she had been describing to him the
finest situation in the finest part in the finest play that
had ever been written. It was a week before her theatre
was to close and before a decision as to plans for the
future must be wrung from her by the pressure of
necessity.</p>

<p>The thought of how he stood had been so much with
him that suddenly, almost without intention, he gave
voice to it. She charmed him that day and he felt as
though the inevitable must not and somehow could not
happen, as though some paradox in the realm of fact
would rescue him, as a witty saying redeems a conversation
which has become to all appearance dull beyond
hope of revival.</p>

<p>"I'm losing you, Ora," he said slowly and deliberately,
fixing his eyes on her. "You'll take this play;
you'll go to America; you're thinking more about
that than anything else now."</p>

<p>A great change came on her face; he rose quickly
and went to her.</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear, I didn't mean to say anything
of that sort to you," he whispered as he bent over her.
"It's quite natural, it's all as it should be. Good God,
you don't think I'm reproaching you?" He bent lower
still, meaning to kiss her. She caught him by the arms
and held him there, so that he could come no nearer
and yet could not draw back; she searched his face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[Pg 261]</span>
then dropped her hands and lay back, looking up at
him with quivering lips and eyes already full of tears.
Blind to his feelings as she had been, yet her quickness
shewed them all to her at his first hint, and she magnified
his accusation till it grew into the bitterest condemnation
of her.</p>

<p>"You've given simply everything for me," she said,
speaking slowly as he had. "I don't know all you've
done for me, but I know it's a great deal. I told you
what Alice Muddock said I was; you remember?" She
sprang to her feet suddenly and threw her arms round
his neck; "I love you," she whispered to him; it was
apology, protest, consolation, all in one. "Ashley, what
do I care about the wretched play? Only I&mdash;I thought
you were interested in it too. How lovely it would be
if we could act it together!" Her smile dawned on her
lips. "Only you'd be rather funny acting, wouldn't
you?" she ended with a joyous little laugh.</p>

<p>Ashley laughed too; he thought that he would certainly
be funny acting; yet he was sure that if he could
have acted with her he need not have lost her.</p>

<p>"But I think I liked you first because you were so
different from all of them at the theatre," she went on,
knitting her brows in a puzzled frown. He might have
recollected that Alice Muddock had liked him because
he was so different from all of them in Buckingham
Palace Road. Well, Alice had turned again to Buckingham
Palace Road, and Bertie Jewett's star was in the
ascendant. "I should hate to have you act," she said,
darting her hand out and clasping his.</p>

<p>They sat silent for some moments; Ora's fingers
pressed his in a friendly understanding fashion.</p>

<p>"There's nobody in the world like you," she said.
He smiled at the praise, since his reward was to be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[Pg 262]</span>
lose her. Things would have their way, and he would
lose her. As Alice back to the business, as Bowdon
back to a suitable alliance, so she back to her theatre.
As for himself, he happened to have nothing to go back
to; somewhat absurdly, he was glad of it.</p>

<p>"All sorts of stupid people are quite happy," Ora
reflected dolefully. "Everything seems to be arranged
so comfortably for them. It's not only that I married
Jack, you know."</p>

<p>She was right there, although she rather underrated
the importance of the action she mentioned. Even
without Jack there would have been difficulties. But
her remark brought Jack, his associations and his associates,
back into Ashley Mead's mind. "Perhaps I shall
run across Jack in America," she added a moment later.</p>

<p>It was indeed not only Jack, but it was largely Jack.
Jack, although he was not all, seemed to embody and
personify all. Ashley's love for her was again faced
and confronted with his distaste for everything about
her. Herself he could see only with his own eyes, but
her surroundings he saw clearly enough through the
eyes of a world which did not truly know her&mdash;the
world of Irene Bowdon, almost the world of Alice Muddock.
Could he then take her from her surroundings?
That could be done at a price to him definite though
high; but what would be the price to her? The answer
came in unhesitating tones; he would be taking
from her the only life that was hers to live. Then he
must tell her that? He almost laughed at the idea; he
knew that he would not be able to endure for a second
the pain there would be in her eyes. To wrench himself
away from her would torture her too sorely; let her
grow away from him and awake some day to find herself
content without him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>"And what a fool all my friends would think me!"
he reflected. But the reflexion did not weigh with him;
he had protected her life from the incursion of Jack
Fenning, he would protect it from his own tyranny.
He leant forward towards her and spoke to her softly.</p>

<p>"Take the play, Ora," he said; "take the part, go to
America, and become still more famous. That's what
you can do and what you ought to do."</p>

<p>"And you? Will you come with me?"</p>

<p>"Why no," he said, smiling. "I must stay and roll
my little stone here. Yours is a big stone and mine
only a little one, but still I must roll my own."</p>

<p>"But I shall be away months."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, long months. But I won't forget you."</p>

<p>"You won't really? I should die if you forgot me,
Ashley. If I go I shall think of you every hour. Oh,
but I'm afraid to go! I know you'll forget me."</p>

<p>He had but little doubt that the forgetfulness would
come, and that it would not come first from him. She
had no inkling of the idea that she could herself cease
to feel for him all that she felt now. She extracted
from him vows of constancy and revelled in the amplitude
of his promises. Presently her mind overleapt the
months of absence, saw in them nothing but a series of
triumphs which would make him more proud of her,
and a prospect of meeting him again growing ever
nearer and nearer and sweetening her success with the
approaching joy of sharing it all with him and telling
him all about it. Anything became sweet, shared with
him; witness the renunciation!</p>

<p>"If I hadn't you, I shouldn't care a bit about the
rest of it," she said. "But somehow having you makes
me want all the rest more. I wonder if all women are
like that when they're as much in love as I am."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>Ashley knew that all women were by no means like
that, but he said that he suspected they were, and
assured Ora that the state of feeling she described was
entirely consistent with a great and permanent love.
As, before, his one object had been to support her
through the renunciation, to make it easy and possible
for her, so now he found himself bending his energies
and exerting his ingenuity to persuading her that there
was no incompatibility between her love and her life,
between her ambition and her passion, between him and
the masterpiece for whose sake she was to leave him.
He had seen her once in despair about herself and
dared not encounter a second time the pain which that
sight of her had given him; he himself might know the
truth of what she was and the outcome of what she did;
he determined that, so far as he could contrive and control
the matter, she should not know it. She should go
and win her triumph, she should go in the sure hope
that he would not change, in the confidence that she
would not, that their friendship would not, that nothing
would. Then she would dry her tears, or weep only in
natural sorrow and with no bitterness of self-accusation.
It seemed worth while to him to embark again on
oceans of pretence for her sake, just as it had seemed
worth while to pretend to believe in the renunciation,
and worth while to break his code by bribing Jack
Fenning with a borrowed thousand pounds.</p>

<p>At this time a second stroke fell on old Sir James
Muddock; worn out with work and money-making, he
had no power to resist. The end came swiftly. It was
announced to Ashley in a letter from Bertie Jewett.
Lady Muddock was prostrate, Bob and Alice overwhelmed
with duties. Bertie begged that his letter
might be regarded as coming from the family; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[Pg 265]</span>
shewed consideration in the way he put this request and
assumed his position with delicacy. Ashley read with a
wry smile, not blaming the writer but wondering scornfully
at the turn of affairs. The old man had once
been almost a father to him, the children near as
brother and sister; now Bertie announced the old man's
death and the children pleaded that they were too
occupied to find time to write to him. He went to the
funeral; through it all his sense of being outside, of
having been put outside, persisted, sharing his mind
with genuine grief. From whatever cause it comes that
a man has been put outside, even although he may have
much to say for himself and the expulsion be of very
questionable justice, it is hard for him to avoid a sense
of ignominy. Ashley felt humiliation even while he
protested that all was done of his own choice. He
spoke to the Muddocks no more than a few kind but
ordinary words; he did not go to the house. Bertie
invited him there and pressed the invitation with the
subdued cordiality which was all that the occasion
allowed; but he would not go on Bertie's invitation.
The resentment which he could not altogether stifle
settled on Bob. Bob was the true head of family and
business now. Why did Bob abdicate? But he had
himself been next in succession; Bob's abdication
would have left the place open for him; he had refused
and renounced; he could not, after all, be very hard on
poor Bob.</p>

<p>Again a few days later came a letter from Bertie
Jewett. This time he made no apology for writing; he
wrote in his official capacity as one of Sir James's
executors. By a will executed a month before death Sir
James left to Ashley Mead, son of his late partner, the
sum of one thousand pounds to be paid free of legacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[Pg 266]</span>
duty. Ashley had no anger against the old man and
accepted this acknowledgment of his father's position
without contempt; it was not left to him but to his
father's son; before the will was made he had been put
outside.</p>

<p>"He might have left you more than that," said Ora.</p>

<p>"You see, I wouldn't go into the business," Ashley
explained.</p>

<p>"No, and you wouldn't do anything he wanted," she
added with a smile.</p>

<p>"It's really very good of him to leave me anything."</p>

<p>"I don't call a thousand pounds anything."</p>

<p>"That's all very well for you, with your wonderful
play up your sleeve," said Ashley, smiling. "But, as
it happens, a thousand pounds is particularly convenient
to me, and I'm very much obliged to poor old Sir
James."</p>

<p>For armed with Bertie Jewett's letter he had no
difficulty in obtaining an overdraft at his bank and
that same evening he wrote a cheque for a thousand
pounds to the order of Lord Bowdon. In allotting
old Sir James's money to this particular purpose he
found a curious pleasure. The Muddock family had
been hard on Ora and hard on him because of Ora;
it seemed turning the tables on them a little to take
a small fraction of their great hoard and by its means
to make them benefactors to Ora, to make them <i>ex post
facto</i> responsible for Jack Fenning's departure, and to
connect them in this way with Ora's life. His action
seemed to forge another link in the chain which bound
together the destinies of the group among which he
had moved. Sir James would have given the thousand
for no such purpose; he had not laboured with any
idea of benefiting Ora Pinsent. Bowdon would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[Pg 267]</span>
like taking the thousand pounds; he had desired to
lay his own gift at Ora's feet. But Sir James being
dead should give, and Lord Bowdon being his lady's
husband should take. So Ashley determined and wrote
his cheque with a smile on his lips. Things turned out
so very oddly.</p>

<p>"What have you done with your legacy?" asked
Ora. When money came in to her, she always "did
something" with at least a large proportion of it; in
other words she got rid of it in some remarkable,
salient, imagination-striking manner, obtaining by this
means a sense of wealth and good fortune which a mere
balance at the bank, whether large or small, could never
give.</p>

<p>Ashley looked up at her as she stood before him.</p>

<p>"I've paid an old debt with it," he said. "I was
very glad to be able to. I'm quite free now."</p>

<p>"Were you in debt? Oh, why didn't you tell me?
I've got a lot of money. How unkind of you, Ashley!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't take your money," said Ashley. "And
I wasn't pressed. My creditor wouldn't have minded
waiting for ever."</p>

<p>"What an angel!" said Ora. She was a little surprised
that under the circumstances Ashley had felt
called upon to pay.</p>

<p>"Exactly," he laughed. "It was Bowdon."</p>

<p>"He's got lots of money. I wonder he takes it."</p>

<p>"I shall make him take it. I borrowed it to get
something I wanted, and I don't feel the thing's mine
till I've paid him off."</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand that," said Ora.</p>

<p>"Don't tell him I told you."</p>

<p>"All right, I won't. I don't suppose I shall get a
chance of telling Lord Bowdon anything. Irene was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span>
like ice to me at the wedding." In reality Irene had
not failed to meet with a decent cordiality the outpouring
of Ora's enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Confound you, I didn't want it," was Lord Bowdon's
form of receipt for the cheque; he scribbled it on half
a sheet of note paper and signed it "B." This was
just what Ashley had expected, and he found new
pleasure in the constraint which he had placed on
his friend's inclination. He shewed the document to
Ora when he next went to see her.</p>

<p>"You were quite right," he said. "Bowdon didn't
want the money. Look here."</p>

<p>Ora read the scrawl and sat turning it over and over
in her fingers.</p>

<p>"But he had to take it," said Ashley with a laugh of
triumph, almost of defiance.</p>

<p>"I should think he'd be a very good friend," said
Ora. "If Irene would let him, I mean," she added
with a smile. "Do you think he'd lend me a thousand
pounds and not want it paid back?" she asked.</p>

<p>"From my knowledge of him," said Ashley, "I'm
quite sure he would."</p>

<p>"People do an awful lot of things for me," said Ora
with a reflective smile. She paused, and added, "But
then other people are often very horrid to me. I
suppose it works out, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>Ashley was engaged in a strenuous attempt to make
it work out, but he had little idea in what way the balance
of profit and loss, good and evil, pleasure and pain,
was to be arrived at.</p>

<p>"You'd do simply anything for me, wouldn't you?"
she went on.</p>

<p>Although he had certainly done much for her, yet he
felt himself an impostor when she looked in his face and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[Pg 269]</span>
asked him that question. There seemed to him nothing
that he would not suffer for her, no advantages, no prospects,
and no friendships that he would not forgo and
sacrifice for her. But he would not "do simply anything
for her." There was much that he would not, as it appeared
to him could not, do for her. Else what easier
than to say, "We know so-and-so about your husband,
and we can find out so-and-so by using the appropriate
methods"? What easier than to say, "I'll go in your
train to America, and while you win the triumphs I'll
do the nosing"? For if he said that to her, if he opened
to her the prospect of being rid, once and for all, of
Jack Fenning, of levelling the only fence between him
and her of which she was conscious, of enabling her to
keep her masterpiece and her triumphs and yet not lose
her lover, her joy would know no bounds and the world
be transfigured for her into a vision of delight. But yet
he could not. All was hers short of negativing himself,
of ceasing to be what he was, of gulfing his life, his
standards, his mind in hers. She judged by what she
saw, and set no bounds to a devotion that seemed boundless.
But to him her praise was accusation, and he
charged himself with giving nothing because he could
not give all.</p>

<p>Ora understood very little why he suddenly caught
her in his arms and kissed her. But she thought it a
charming way of answering her question.</p>

<p>"Poor Ashley!" she sighed, as she escaped from his
embrace. She had occasional glimpses of the imperfection
of his happiness, just as she had occasional
pathetic intuitions of what her own nature was.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a><span>CHAPTER XIX</span>
<span class="smaller">COLLATERAL EFFECTS</span></h2>


<p>On the whole Irene Bowdon felt that she ought to
thank heaven, not perhaps in any rapturous outpouring
of tremulous joy, but in a sober give-and-take
spirit which set possible evil against actual good, struck
the balance, and made an entry of a reasonably large
figure on the credit side of the sheet. Surely it was in
this spirit that sensible people dealt with heaven? If
once or twice in her life she had not been sensible, to
repeat such aberrations would little become an experienced
and twice-married woman. You could not have
everything; and Lord Bowdon's conduct had been extremely
satisfactory. Only for two days of one week
had he relapsed into that apparent moodiness, that
alternation of absent-mindedness with uncomfortable
apologies, which had immediately succeeded the offer
of his hand. On this occasion something in a letter
from Ashley Mead seemed to upset him. The letter had
a cheque in it, and Irene believed that the letter and
cheque vexed her husband. She had too much tact to
ask questions, and contented herself, so far as outward
behaviour went, with Bowdon's remark that Ashley was
a young fool. But her instinct, sharpened by the old
jealousy, had loudly cried, "Ora Pinsent!" She was
glad to read in the papers that Ora was to go to America.
Yes, on the whole she would thank heaven, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[Pg 271]</span>
assure herself that Lord Bowdon would have made her
his wife anyhow; that is, in any case, and without&mdash;She
never finished the phrase which began with this
"without."</p>

<p>So Ora Pinsent was going to America. Surely madness
stopped somewhere? Surely Ashley Mead would
not go with her? Irene had never given up hopes of
Ashley, and at this first glimmer of a chance she was
prepared to do battle for him. She had never quite
reconciled herself to Bertie Jewett; her old dislike of
the ribbon-selling man and the ribbon-selling atmosphere
so far persisted that she had accepted, rather than
welcomed, the prospect of Bertie. She wrote and begged
Alice Muddock to come across to tea. She and Bowdon
were in her house in Queen's Gate, his not being
yet prepared to receive her. She fancied that she saw
her way to putting everything right, to restoring the
<i>status quo ante</i>, and to obliterating altogether the effect
of Ora Pinsent's incursion; she still felt a responsibility
for the incursion. Of course she was aware that just
now matrimonial projects must be in the background
at Kensington Palace Gardens; but the way might be
felt and the country explored.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jewett, Mr. Jewett, Mr. Jewett;" this seemed
the burden of Alice's conversation. The name was not
mentioned in a romantic way, nor in connexion with
romantic subjects; it cropped up when they talked of
the death, of the funeral, of the business, of money matters,
future arrangements, everything that goes to make
up the ordinary round of life. Alice was quite free from
embarrassment and shewed no self-consciousness about
the name; but its ubiquity was in the highest degree
significant in Irene's eyes. She knew well that the man
who has made himself indispensable has gone more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[Pg 272]</span>
than half-way towards making any other man superfluous,
and she seemed to be faced with the established
fact of Bertie Jewett's indispensability. The time would
come when he would ask his reward; either he must
receive it or he must vanish, carrying off with him all
the comfort his presence had given and breaking the
habit of looking to him and leaning on him which had
become so strong and constant. If Irene meant to enter
the lists against Bertie, she would be challenging an
opponent who knew how to fight.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of Ashley Mead?" she
asked, as she lifted the teapot and poured out the tea.</p>

<p>"He came to the funeral, but of course we had no
talk, and he's not been since."</p>

<p>"You haven't been asking people, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"We haven't asked him," said Alice calmly. She
took her tea and looked at her hostess with perfect
composure.</p>

<p>"He couldn't come just now without being invited,
you know," Irene suggested.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Alice, rather doubtfully. "I
don't think he wants to come." She paused, and then
added deliberately, "And I don't want him to come."
Now she flushed a very little, although her face remained
steady and calm. She did not seem to shrink
from the discussion to which her friend opened the
way. "It would be nonsense to pretend that he's
what he used to be to us," she went on. "You know
that as well as I do, Irene."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it," declared Irene pettishly.
"I think you're hard on him; all men are
foolish sometimes; it doesn't last long." Had not Lord
Bowdon soon returned to grace, soon and entirely?</p>

<p>"Oh, it's just that you see what they are," said Alice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[Pg 273]</span>
She set down her cup and gazed absently out of the
window. Irene was irritated; her view had been that
momentary weaknesses in a man were to be combated,
and were not to be accepted as final indications of what
the man was; she had acted on that view in regard to
her husband, and, as has been stated, on the whole she
thanked heaven. She thought that Alice also might, if
she chose, bring herself to a position in which she could
thank heaven moderately; but it was not to be done by
slamming the door in the face of a prodigal possibly
repentant. She cast about for a delicate method of remarking
that Ora Pinsent was going to America.</p>

<p>"It was quite inevitable that he should drift away
from us," Alice continued. "I see that now. I don't
think we're any of us bitter about it."</p>

<p>"He needn't go on drifting away unless you like."</p>

<p>"It isn't very likely that I should make any efforts
to call him back," said Alice, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Irene crossly.</p>

<p>"Well, do women do that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course they do, my dear."</p>

<p>Alice's smile expressed a very clear opinion of such
conduct, supposing it to exist. Irene grew red for an
instant and pushed her chair back from the table. Anger
makes delicate methods of remarking on important facts
seem unnecessary.</p>

<p>"You know Ora Pinsent's off to America?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No, I know nothing of Miss Pinsent's movements,"
said Alice haughtily. "I don't read theatrical gossip."</p>

<p>Irene looked at her, rose, and came near. She stood
looking down at Alice. Alice looked up with a smile;
the irritation in both seemed to vanish.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear girl, why must you be so proud?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[Pg 274]</span>
asked Irene, with a nervous little laugh. "You cared
for him, Alice."</p>

<p>"Yes; all the world knew that. I didn't realise,
though, quite how well they knew it."</p>

<p>"And now you don't?"</p>

<p>Alice's eyes did not leave her friend's face as she
paused in consideration.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose I shall ever be so happy as I used
to think I should be with Ashley Mead," she said at
last. "But I couldn't now. I should always be thinking
of&mdash;of what's been happening lately. Irene, I
loathe that sort of thing, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, with men it's just&mdash;" Irene began.</p>

<p>"With some sort of men, I suppose so," Alice interrupted.
"I tried to think it didn't matter, but&mdash;Could
you care for a man if you knew he had done what Ashley
has?"</p>

<p>In ninety hours out of a hundred, in ninety moods
out of a hundred, Irene would have been ready with the
"No" that Alice expected so confidently from her;
with that denial she would instinctively have shielded
herself from a breath of suspicion. But now, looking
into the grave eyes upturned to hers, she answered with
a break in her voice,</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; we must take what we can get, you
know." Then she turned away and walked back to her
tea-table; her own face was in shadow there, and thence
she watched Alice's, which seemed to rise very firm and
very white out of the high black collar of her mourning
gown. She loved Alice, but, as she watched, she knew
why Ashley Mead had left her and given himself over
to Ora Pinsent; she had not often seen so nearly in the
way men saw. Then she thought of what Bertie Jewett
was; he could not love as this girl deserved to be loved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[Pg 275]</span>
"And we don't always get what we deserve," she added,
forcing another nervous laugh. "Most women have to
put up with something like what you mean, only they're
sensible and don't think about it."</p>

<p>"I'm considered sensible," said Alice, smiling.</p>

<p>"Sensible people are only silly in different ways from
silly people," Irene declared, with a touch of fresh irritation
in her voice. "Well then, it's no use?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"It's no use trying to undo what's done." Alice
got up and came and kissed her friend. "It was like
you to try, though," she said.</p>

<p>"And I suppose it's to be&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It's not to be anybody," Alice interrupted. "Fancy
talking about it now!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's conventional. You needn't mind that
with me."</p>

<p>"Really I'm not thinking about it." But even as she
spoke her face grew thoughtful. "Our life's arranged
for us, really," she said. "We haven't much to do with
it. Look how I was born to the business!"</p>

<p>"And you'll go on in the business?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I used to think I should like to get away
from it. Perhaps I should like still; but I never shall.
There are terribly few things one gets a choice about."</p>

<p>"Marriage is one," Irene persisted, almost imploringly.</p>

<p>"Do you think it is, as a rule?" asked Alice doubtfully.</p>

<p>Their talk had drawn them closer together and renewed
the bonds of sympathy, but herein lay its only
comfort for Irene Bowdon. The disposition that Alice
shewed seemed clearly to presage Bertie Jewett's success
and to prove how far he had already progressed. She
wondered to find so much done and to see how Ashley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[Pg 276]</span>
had lost his place in the girl's conception of what her
life must be. "I should have fought more," Irene
reflected, and went on to ask whether that were not
because she also felt more than her friend, or at least
differently; did not the temperament which occasioned
defeat also soften it? Yet the girl was not happy; she
was rather making the best of an apparently necessary
lack of happiness; life was a niggard of joy, but by
good management the small supply might be so disposed
as to make a good show and so spread out as to
cover a handsome space. Against the acceptance of
such a view Irene's soul protested. It was dressing the
shop-window finely when there was no stock inside.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mind what a man had thought," she
said, "if I could make him think as I wanted him to
now."</p>

<p>"No, but you'd know him too well to imagine that
you ever could," said Alice.</p>

<p>A little inhuman, wasn't it? The old question rose
again in Irene's mind, even while she was feeling full
of sympathy and of love. It was all too cold, too clear-sighted,
too ruthless; if you were very fond of people,
you did not let yourself know too well what you did
not wish to think about them; you ought to be able
to forget, to select, to idealise; else how could two
people ever love one another? There must be a partiality
of view; love must pretend. She could fancy
Ashley's humorously alarmed look at the idea of living
in company with perfect clear-sightedness. As for Ora&mdash;but
surely the objection here would come even
sooner and more clamorously from clear-sightedness
itself?</p>

<p>"I daresay you're right, dear, but it doesn't sound
very encouraging," she said. "I declare it's a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[Pg 277]</span>
thing I'm married already, or I should never have
dared after this!"</p>

<p>"If it is like that, we may just as well admit it," said
Alice, with a smile and a sigh. "I must go back," she
added. "Mr. Jewett's coming to dinner to talk over
some business with me."</p>

<p>Business and Mr. Jewett! That indeed seemed now
the way of it. Irene kissed her friend with rueful
emphasis.</p>

<p>At this time Lady Muddock, while conceiving herself
prostrate and crushed under the blow which had fallen
on her, was in reality very placid and rather happy.
As a dog loves his master she had loved her husband;
the dog whines at the master's loss, but after a time
will perceive that there is nobody to prevent him from
having a hunt in the coverts. A repressive force was
removed, and Lady Muddock enjoyed the novel feeling
of being a free agent. And everything went very well
according to her ideas. Minna Soames, whose father
had been a clergyman, and who had sung only at concerts,
would become her daughter-in-law, and Bertie
Jewett her son-in-law; Minna would cease to sing, and
Bertie would carry on the business; Bob would be
perfectly happy, and Alice would act with true wisdom
and presently find her reward. She had a sense of
being at home in all things, of there being nothing that
puzzled or shocked or upset her. She disliked the unfamiliar;
she had therefore disliked Ora Pinsent, even
while she was flattered by knowing her; but it was just
as flattering and at the same time more comfortable to
have known and voluntarily to have ceased to know
her. As for Ashley Mead, he had never let her feel
quite at ease with him; and the society which he had
been the means of bringing to the house was not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[Pg 278]</span>
sort which suited her. She made preparations for
taking a handsome villa at Wimbledon; to that she
would retire when Bob brought his bride to Kensington
Palace Gardens. In a word, the world seemed to be
fitting itself to her size most admirably.</p>

<p>Bowdon had been paying a visit of condolence to her
while Alice was with his wife&mdash;so Irene had contrived to
distribute the quartette&mdash;and discovered her state of
mind with an amusement largely infected with envy.
His own life was of course laid on broader lines than
hers; there was a wider social side to it and a public
side; but he also had come to a time of life and a state
of things when he must fit himself to his world and his
world to him, much in Lady Muddock's fashion&mdash;when
things became definite, vistas shortened, and the actual
became the only possible. The return of his thousand
pounds typified this change to him; it closed an incident
which had once seemed likely to prevent or retard the
process of settling down to which he was now adapting
and resigning himself; he admitted with a sigh that he
had put it off as long as most men, and that, now it was
come, it had more alleviations for him than for most.
Well, the ground had to be cleared for the next generation;
theirs would be the open playing-fields; it was
time for him to go into the house and sit down by the
fire. What was there to quarrel with in that? Did not
<i>placens uxor</i> sit on the other side of the hearth? And
though tempests were well enough in youth, in advanced
years they were neither pleasant nor becoming. But he
wished that it was all as grateful to him as it was to Lady
Muddock.</p>

<p>Alice came in before he left and took him to walk
with her in the garden. The burden of her talk chimed
in with his mood; again she dwelt on the view that one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[Pg 279]</span>
place was somewhere in the world, that by most people
at all events it had only to be found, not made, but that
sorrow and a fiasco waited on any mistake about it. She
spoke only for herself, but she seemed to speak for him
also, expressing by her subdued acquiescence in giving
up what was not hers, and her resolute facing of what
was, the temper which he must breed in himself if he
were to travel the rest of the way contentedly.</p>

<p>"But it's a bit of a bore, isn't it?" he asked, suddenly
standing still and looking at her with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it's a bit of a bore," said she. Then
she went on rather abruptly, "Have you seen Ashley
since you came back?"</p>

<p>"Only once, for a moment at the club."</p>

<p>"Is he getting on well? Will he do well?"</p>

<p>"If he likes," said Bowdon, shrugging his shoulders.
"But he's a queer fellow."</p>

<p>"I don't think he quite agrees with us in what we've
been saying."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. At any rate I fancy he
won't act on it."</p>

<p>"There's no use talking about it," she said with an
impatience only half suppressed. "He's so different
from what he used to be."</p>

<p>"Not so very, a little perhaps. Then you're a little
different from what you used to be, aren't you?"</p>

<p>She looked at him with interest.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she said questioningly.</p>

<p>"Add the two little differences together and they
make a big one."</p>

<p>"A big difference between us?"</p>

<p>"That's what I mean. I feel the same thing about
him myself. He's not for settling down, Miss Muddock."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose we both know why that is," she said.
"We needn't mention names, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, we know how it is even if we don't know why
it is; but it isn't all Miss Pinsent, or&mdash;" He paused
an instant and ended with a question. "Or why doesn't
he settle down there?"</p>

<p>She seemed to consider his question, but shook her
head as though she found no answer. To adduce the
obvious objection, the Fenning objection, seemed inconsistent
with the sincerity into which their talk had drifted.</p>

<p>"I tell you what," said Bowdon, "I'm beginning to
think that it doesn't much matter what sort a man is,
but he ought to be one sort or the other. Don't you
know what I mean?"</p>

<p>She walked by his side in silence again for a few minutes,
then she turned to him.</p>

<p>"Are we contemptuous, or are we envious, or what
are we, we people of one sort?" she asked.</p>

<p>"On my honour I don't know," answered Bowdon,
shaking his head and laughing a little.</p>

<p>"I think I'm contemptuous," she said, and looked in
his face to find an equal candour. But he did not give
his decision; he would not admit that he inclined still
a little towards the mood of envy. "Anyhow it must
be strange to be like that," she said; she had thought
the same thing before when she sat in the theatre, watching
Ora Pinsent act. Then she had watched with an
outside disinterested curiosity in the study of a being
from another world who could not, as it had seemed,
make any difference to her world or to her; but Ora
had made differences for her, or at least had brought
differences to light. So the various lines of life run in
and out, now meeting and now parting, each following
its own curve, lead where it may.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>"I must run away," said Bowdon, "or I shall keep
my wife waiting for dinner."</p>

<p>"And I must go and dress, or I shall keep Mr. Jewett
waiting for dinner."</p>

<p>They parted with no more exchange of confidence
than lay in the hint of a half-bitter smile. Lord
Bowdon walked home to Queen's Gate, meditating on
the Developments and Manifestations of the Modern
Spirit. He yielded to fashion so far as to shape his
phrase in this way and to affix mental capital letters
to the dignified words. But in truth he was conscious
that the affair was a very old one, that there had been
always a Modern Spirit. In the state of innocency Adam
fell, and in the days of villainy poor Jack Falstaff; the
case would seem to be much the same with the Modern
Spirit. Still there is good in a label, to comfort the
consciences of sinners and to ornament the eloquence
of saints.</p>

<p>The eloquence of saints was on the lips of his wife
that evening when they dined together, and Bowdon
listened to it with complete intellectual assent. He
could not deny the force of her strictures on Ashley
Mead nor the justness of her analysis of Ora Pinsent.
But he did not love her in this mood; we do not
always love people best when they convince us most.
Ashley was terribly foolish, Ora seemed utterly devoid
of the instinct of morality, intimated Irene.</p>

<p>"No," said Bowdon, with a sudden undeliberated
decisiveness, "that's just what she's got. She hasn't
anything else, but she has that."</p>

<p>The flow of Irene's talk was stemmed; she looked
across at him with a vexed enquiring air.</p>

<p>"You've not seen anything like so much of her as I
have," she objected. "Really I don't see what you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[Pg 282]</span>
know about it, Frank. Besides men never understand
women as women do."</p>

<p>"Sometimes better, and I'm quite right here," he
persisted. "Why did she send for her husband?"</p>

<p>"I don't think there was ever any real question of his
coming." This remark was not quite sincere.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there was," said Bowdon with a smile.
The smile hinted knowledge and thereby caused annoyance
to his wife. How did he come to know, or to
think he knew, so much of Ora? But it was no great
thing that had inspired his protest; it was only the
memory of how she once said, "Don't."</p>

<p>"I'm going to see her," Irene announced in resolute
tones. "I used to have some influence over her, and
I'm going to try and use it. I may do some good."</p>

<p>"In what direction, dear?" There was a touch of
scepticism in Bowdon's voice.</p>

<p>"About Ashley Mead. I do believe everything could
be made happy again. Frank, I'm not reconciled to
Bertie Jewett yet."</p>

<p>Bowdon shook his head; he was reconciled to Bertie
Jewett and to the tendency of events which involved
the success of Bertie Jewett.</p>

<p>"And she ought to go back to her husband," Irene
pursued.</p>

<p>The Modern Spirit had not, it must be presumed,
left Lord Bowdon entirely untouched, else he could
not have dissented from this dictum; or was it only
that a very vivid remembrance of Mr. Fenning rose
in his mind?</p>

<p>"I'm hanged if she ought," he said emphatically.
"And if you only knew what the fellow's like&mdash;" He
came to a sharp stop; his wife's surprised eyes were
set on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>"You don't know what he's like, you've never seen
him; you told me so, long ago, when I first got to
know her." Lord Bowdon appeared embarrassed.
"Wasn't it true?" asked Irene severely.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was true," he answered, and truly, for, at
the time he said it, it had been true.</p>

<p>"Then how do you know what he's like?" she persisted.
The servants had left them to their coffee.
Irene came round and sat down close to her husband.
"You know something, something you didn't mean me
to know. What is it, Frank?"</p>

<p>Bowdon looked at her steadily. He had meant to
tell nothing; but he had already told too much. A
sudden gleam of understanding came into her eyes;
her quick intuition discerned a connection between
this thing and the other incident which had puzzled
her.</p>

<p>"I believe it's something to do with that cheque
Ashley Mead sent you," she said. She would not
move her eyes from his face.</p>

<p>"I'm not at liberty to tell you anything about it.
Of course I'm not going to deny that there's a secret.
But I can't tell you about it, Irene."</p>

<p>"You would be quite safe in telling me." She rose
and stood looking down on him. "You ought to tell
me," she said. "You ought to tell me anything that
concerns both you and Ora Pinsent."</p>

<p>She was amazed to say this, and he to hear it. The
one point of silence, of careful silence, the one thing
which neither had dared to speak of to the other, the
one hidden spring which had moved the conduct of
both, suddenly became a matter of speech on her lips
to him. Suddenly she faced the question and demanded
that he also should face it. She admitted and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[Pg 284]</span>
claimed that what touched him and Ora Pinsent must
touch her also. And he did not contest the claim.</p>

<p>"I must know, if&mdash;if we're to go on, Frank," she
said.</p>

<p>"There's much less than you think," said he. "But
I'll tell you. I tell you in confidence, you know.
Fenning came. That's all."</p>

<p>Irene made no comment. That was not all; the
cheque from Ashley Mead was not explained. Bowdon
proceeded with his story. He told what he had to tell
in short sharp sentences. "The fellow was impossible."
"It was impossible to let her see him." "He was a
rascal." "He drank." Pauses of silence were interspersed.
"It would have killed her." "He only wanted
money of her." "The idea of his going near her was
intolerable." "She had forgotten what he was, or he
had gone down-hill terribly."</p>

<p>"And the money?" asked Irene, in a low whisper.
She had seated herself again, and was looking before
her into the fireplace.</p>

<p>"He came for money; he had to have it if he was to
go. Ashley asked me for it. I gave it him."</p>

<p>"As a loan? He sent it back."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it as a loan. But, as you say, he's
sent it back."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he didn't want her to be indebted to me
for it." His bitterness cropped out in his tone; he had
desired a share in the work which Ashley would not
give him. He must have forgotten his wife for the moment,
or he would have kept that bitterness out of his
voice; indeed for the moment he seemed to have forgotten
her, as he leant his head on his hand and stared
gloomily at the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>"So we gave him the money, and he went away
again." She was silent. "You wouldn't wonder so
much if you'd seen him."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," she said. "I haven't seen him, but
I don't wonder. And you never told her?"</p>

<p>"No, I never told her."</p>

<p>"Nor Ashley Mead?"</p>

<p>"No, he's never told her, either. And you mustn't."
For an instant his tone was rigidly imperative.</p>

<p>In spite of the tone she seemed to pay no heed to
the last words.</p>

<p>"You kept it all from her?" she asked again.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Does that seem very wrong to
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," she groaned.</p>

<p>"Or very strange?" he asked, turning his head and
looking towards her.</p>

<p>She rose to her feet suddenly, walked to the mantel-piece,
and stood there with her back towards him.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "not very strange. It's only what
I knew before. It's not strange." She turned round
and faced him; she was rather pale, but she smiled a
little.</p>

<p>"I knew all the time that you were in love with her
too," she said. "Of course you wouldn't let the man
go near her!"</p>

<p>Bowdon raised his eyes to his wife's face. She turned
away again.</p>

<p>"I knew it when I made you propose to me," she
said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a><span>CHAPTER XX</span>
<span class="smaller">THE WAYS DIVIDE</span></h2>


<p>It may safely be said that, had Bowdon's wife been
such as Ora Pinsent, or Bowdon himself of the clay of
which Ora was made, the foregoing conversation would
not have stopped where it did, nor with the finality
which in fact marked its close. It would have been
lengthened, resumed, and elaborated; its dramatic possibilities
in the way of tragedy and comedy (it was
deficient in neither line) would have been developed;
properly and artistically handled, it must have led to
something. But ordinary folk, especially perhaps ordinary
English folk, make of their lives one grand waste
of dramatic possibilities, and as things fell out the talk
seemed to lead to nothing. When Irene had made her
remark about knowing that her husband was in love
with Ora even when she induced him to propose to herself,
she stood a moment longer by the mantel-piece and
then went upstairs, as her custom was; he held the
door open for her, as his custom was; sat down again,
drank a small glass of cognac, and smoked a cigar, all
as his custom was; in about half an hour he joined
her in the drawing-room and they talked about the
house they were going to take in Scotland for the
autumn. Neither then nor in the days that followed
was any reference made to this after-dinner conversation,
nor to the startling way in which the hidden had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[Pg 287]</span>
become open, the veil been for a moment lifted, and the
thing which was between them declared and recognised.
The dramatic possibilities were, in fact, absolutely neglected
and thrown away; to all appearance the conversation
might never have taken place, so little effect did
it seem to have, so absolutely devoid of result it seemed
to be. It was merely that for ever there it was, never to
be forgotten, always to form part of their consciousness,
to define permanently the origin of their relations to
one another, to make it quite plain how it was that they
came to be passing their lives together. That it did all
these not unimportant things and yet never led to
another acute situation or striking scene shews how
completely the dramatic possibilities were thrown away.</p>

<p>It did not even alter Irene's resolve of going to see
Ora Pinsent. To acquiesce in existing facts appeared
the only thing left to do so far as she herself was concerned:
but the facts might still be modified for others;
this was what she told herself. Besides this feeling, she
was impelled by an increased curiosity, a new desire to
see again and to study the woman who had been the
occasion of this conversation, who had united her husband
and her friend in a plot and made them both sacrifice
more than money because they would not have
Jack Fenning come near her. We are curious when we
are jealous; where lies the power, what is the secret of
the strength which conquers us?</p>

<p>The scene in the little house at Chelsea was very
much the same as Alice Muddock had once chanced on
there. Sidney Hazlewood and Babba Flint were with
Ora; after a swift embrace Ora resumed her talk with
them. The talk was of tours, triumphs, and thousands;
the masterpiece was finished; it bulged nobly in
Babba's pocket, type-written, in brown covers, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[Pg 288]</span>
pink ribbons to set off its virgin beauty. On the table
lay a large foolscap sheet, fairly written; this was an
agreement, ready for Ora's signature; when it had received
that, it would be, as Hazlewood was reminding
Ora, an agreement. Ora was struck anew with the unexpectedness
of this result of merely writing one's
name, and shewed a disinclination to take the decisive
step. She preferred to consider tour, triumphs, and
thousands as hypothetical delights; she got nearly as
much enjoyment out of them and was bound to nothing.
Babba smoked cigarettes with restless frequency and
nervous haste; a horse and cart could almost have been
driven along the wrinkle on Mr. Hazlewood's brow.
He looked sixty, if he looked a day, that afternoon.
Irene sat unnoticed, undisturbed, with the expression in
her eyes which a woman wears when she is saying,
"Yes, I suppose it would be so; I suppose men would.
I don't feel it myself, but I understand how it would
be." The expression is neither of liking nor of dislike;
it is of unwilling acquiescence in a fact recognised but
imperfectly comprehended. The presence of the power
is admitted, the source but half discovered; the analysis
of a drug need not be complete before we are able to
discern its action.</p>

<p>"I won't sign to-day," said Ora. "I might change my
mind."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, don't!" cried Babba, seizing another
cigarette.</p>

<p>"That's just why we want you to sign to-day," said
Hazlewood, passing his hand over his forehead in a vain
effort to obliterate the wrinkle.</p>

<p>"Then you'd bring an action against me!" exclaimed
Ora indignantly.</p>

<p>"Without a doubt&mdash;and win it," said Hazlewood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>"I hate agreements. I hate being committed to
things. Oh, do give me a cigarette!"</p>

<p>After all, was it not strange that both the men should
have done what they had for her? Was there not a
touch of vulgarity in her? To the jealous eyes of a
woman, perhaps. "But men don't see that," thought
Irene Bowdon as she sat on the sofa; she was in that
favourite seat of her hostess', by the little table, the
portrait in its silver frame, and the flower-vase that once
had hidden the letter from Bridgeport, Connecticut.</p>

<p>There was more in Ora's mood than her natural indecision,
or her congenital dislike of being bound, or her
ingrained dread of agreements which were agreements.
The men did not see this; what do men see? But the
observant woman on the sofa saw it. The power of the
tour, the triumphs, and the thousands was fought by
another power; the battle raged in the heart of the
woman who would not sign, who chaffed and laughed
and protested petulantly, who put off her persuaders
by any art or device her beauty excused or her waywardness
furnished, who would say neither yes nor no.
The conflict declared itself in her nervous laughs, in her
ridiculous puffings at an ill-used cigarette, in the air of
attention which seemed to expect or hope for a new
arrival, perhaps somebody to rescue her, to decide for
her, to take the burden of choice from the shoulders
that she shrugged so deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"It's awful to go wandering about over there for
months," she said. "I hate you both, oh, how I hate
you both!"</p>

<p>"The part&mdash;" began Babba.</p>

<p>"Do be quiet. I know it's a lovely part," cried Ora.
Then she turned suddenly to Irene and began to
laugh. "Don't tell anybody how silly I am, Irene,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[Pg 290]</span>
she said, and she looked at the clock again with that
expectant hopeful air.</p>

<p>"It's now or never," declared Mr. Hazlewood, with
much solemnity.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" said Ora peevishly. "It's now or
to-morrow; and to-morrow will do just as well."</p>

<p>Hazlewood and Babba exchanged glances. After all,
to-morrow would be just in time; they had wrestled
long with her to-day.</p>

<p>"If you'll take your Bible oath to settle one way or
the other to-morrow&mdash;" Babba began.</p>

<p>"I will, I will, oh, of course I will," Ora interrupted,
infinite joy and relief lighting up her face. "I shall
know quite well by to-morrow. Do go now, there's
good men. I'll settle it all in five minutes to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Mind you do," said Babba, looking round for his
hat. Hazlewood had his and was staring at the crown
of it; a coach and four might have hazarded passage
along the wrinkle now.</p>

<p>"You'll be just the same to-morrow," he observed,
hardly reproachfully, but with an air of sad knowledge.</p>

<p>"I shan't," said Ora indignantly. "If you think
that of me, I wonder you have anything to do with me.
Oh, but I suppose I'm useful! Nobody cares for me&mdash;only
just for the use I am to them!"</p>

<p>Both men smiled broadly; greatly to her surprise
and disgust Irene found herself exchanging what she
was obliged to call a grin with Babba Flint; she had
not expected to live to do that.</p>

<p>"That's just it, Miss Pinsent," said Babba. "You
ain't clever, and you ain't pleasant, and you ain't
pretty; but the fool of a public happens to like you,
so we've all got to pretend you are; and we mean to
work you to the last tanner, don't you know?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Hazlewood smiled sardonically; he did not
admire Babba's wit.</p>

<p>"This time to-morrow then," said Ora, ringing the
bell. "Oh, and take your agreement with you; I won't
have the odious thing here." She flung it at Babba,
who caught it cleverly. "I couldn't live in the room
with it," she said.</p>

<p>Ora waited till she heard the house door shut upon
her visitors. "Thank goodness!" she cried then, as she
sank into a chair opposite Irene. "How good of you
to come and see me," she went on.</p>

<p>Irene was hard on her search; she did not allow
herself to be turned aside by mere civilities, however
charming might be the cordiality with which they were
uttered.</p>

<p>"Are you really going to America?" she asked.</p>

<p>Ora's face grew plaintive again; she thought that she
had got rid of that question till the next day.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so. Yes. I don't know, I'm sure."
She leant forward towards her friend. "I suppose
you're awfully happy, aren't you, Irene?"</p>

<p>Irene smiled; she had no intention of casting doubts
on her bliss in her present company.</p>

<p>"Then do be kind to me, because I'm awfully miserable.
Now you're looking as if you were going to tell
me it was my own fault. Please don't, dear. That
doesn't do any good at all."</p>

<p>"Not the least I'm sure, to you," said Irene Bowdon.</p>

<p>Ora scanned her friend's face anxiously and timidly.
She was speculating on the amount of sympathy to be
expected; she knew that on occasion Irene could be
almost as unjust as Alice Muddock. She was afraid
that Irene would break out on her. Irene was in no
such mood; coldly, critically, jealously observant, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[Pg 292]</span>
waited for this woman to throw new lights on herself, to
exhibit the kind of creature she was, to betray her
weakness and to explain her power.</p>

<p>"Can't you make up your mind whether to go or
not?" she asked with a smile.</p>

<p>"If you only knew what going means to me!" cried
Ora. Suddenly she rose and flung herself on her knees
beside her friend. Irene had an impulse to push her
away; but she sat quite still and suffered Ora to take
her hand. "You see, he can't come with me," Ora went
on, with a pathetic air which seemed to bemoan the
wanton impossibility of what might, had it been so disposed,
have been quite possible.</p>

<p>"Who can't go with you? Mr. Mead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ashley; who else could I mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't suppose he can." Irene gave a short
laugh.</p>

<p>"No," said Ora resentfully. "He can't, you see." She
looked up in Irene's face. "At least I suppose he
can't?" she said in a coaxing voice; then dreariness
conquered and reigned in her whole air as she added
mournfully, "Anyhow, I'm sure he won't."</p>

<p>"I hope to goodness he won't," said Irene Bowdon.</p>

<p>Ora drew a little away, as though surprised; then she
nodded and smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd say that," she remarked.</p>

<p>"What in the world else should I say?" Irene
demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing, I suppose," sighed Ora. "It would be
quite out of the question, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Quite," said Irene, and shut her lips close as the
one word left them. Her patience was failing. There
were two possible things, to be respectable, and not to
be respectable; but there was no such third course as
Ora seemed to expect to have found for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>"Of course if I give up the tour," said Ora, in a
meditative tone, "things could go on as they are."</p>

<p>"Could they?" cried Irene. "Oh, I don't know how
they are, and I don't want to ask. Well, then, I suppose
I don't believe the worst or I shouldn't be here;
but almost everybody does, and if you go on much
longer quite everybody will."</p>

<p>"I don't mind a bit about that," remarked Ora.
Her tone was simple and matter-of-fact; she was neither
making a confession nor claiming a merit. "How can
I be expected to? I lost all feeling of that sort when
Jack didn't come. He was the person who ought to
have cared, and he didn't care enough to come when I
said he might."</p>

<p>The reference to Mr. Fenning touched Irene's wound,
and it smarted again. But she was loyal to her husband's
injunction and gave no hint which might disturb
Ora's certainty that Jack Fenning had not come.</p>

<p>"I think you'd better go away before you've quite
ruined Ashley Mead's life," she said in cold and deliberate
tones; "and before you've ruined yourself too,
if you care about that."</p>

<p>She expected to be met by one of Ora's old pitiful
protests against harsh and unsympathetic judgments;
the look in Ora's eyes a little while ago had foreshadowed
such an appeal. But it did not come now.
Ora regarded her with a faint smile and brows slightly
raised.</p>

<p>"I don't see," she said, "how all sorts of different
people can be expected all to behave in exactly the
same way."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it?" asked Irene irritably.</p>

<p>"Well, that's what it comes to, if you listen to what
people say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>"Do you mean if you listen to what I say?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ora, with a smile, "you and Miss Muddock
and all the rest of them. And I suppose you've
made Lord Bowdon as bad by now? I'm not going to
think about it any more." She shook her head as though
to clear away these mists of conventional propriety. "If
people can be happy anyhow, why shouldn't they?"
she added.</p>

<p>"I believe," said Irene, "that you really think you're
coming to a new resolution. As if you'd ever thought
of anything except what you liked!"</p>

<p>Ora shook her head again, this time in gentle denial;
memories of infinite sacrifices to the Ideal rose before
her; for example, there was the recalling of her husband.
But she would not argue as to her own merits;
she had ceased to expect justice or to hope for
approbation.</p>

<p>"It's all no use," she said despondently. "I may
say what I like, but he won't come." Again she spoke
as though she would not give up the tour and would
sign the agreement on the morrow, and would do this
although she knew that Ashley would not come. Then
they would separate! To her own sheer amazement
and downright shame Irene Bowdon felt a sharp pang
of sorrow; for Ora looked puzzled and forlorn, as
though she did what she could not help and suffered
keenly at the price she had to pay. Their eyes met,
and Ora divined the newly born sympathy. "You are
sorry for me, aren't you?" she murmured, stretching
her hands out towards her friend.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Irene, with a laugh. "I actually am."
She was beginning to understand the transaction which
had sent Jack Fenning away richer by a thousand
pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>"I know you'd help me if you could," Ora went on,
"but nobody can; that's the worst of it." She paused
for a moment, and then remarked with a mournful
smile, "And suppose Babba's wrong and the play does
no good after all!"</p>

<p>Irene's warmth of feeling was chilled; she did not
understand the glamour of the play so well as she appreciated
the pathos of the parting. The strength of
the tie came home to her, the power which fought
against it was beyond her experience or imagination.</p>

<p>"I wonder you can think about the play at all," she
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, you've no idea what a part it is for me!" cried
Ora. But her plea sounded weak, even flippant, to
Irene; she condemned it as the fruit of vanity and the
sign of shallowness. Ora caused in others changes of
mood almost as quick as those she herself suffered.</p>

<p>"Well, if you go because you like the part, you can't
expect me to be very sorry for you. It's a very good
thing you should go; and your part will console you
for&mdash;for what you leave behind."</p>

<p>Ora made no answer; her look of indecision and
puzzle had returned; it was useless to try to make
another understand what she herself failed to analyse.
But as the business drew Alice Muddock, so the play
drew her; and the business had helped to turn Alice's
heart from Ashley Mead. He had not been able there
to conquer what was in the blood and mingled its roots
with the roots of life. No thought of a parallel came to
Irene Bowdon; any point of likeness between the two
women or their circumstances would have seemed to
her impossible and the idea of it absurd; they were
wide asunder as the poles. What she did dimly feel was
the fashion in which Ashley seemed to stand midway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[Pg 296]</span>
between them, within hearing of both and yet divided
from each; she approached the conclusion that he was
not really made for either, because he had points which
likened him to both. But this was little more than a
passing gleam of insight; she fell back on the simpler
notion that after all Ashley and Ora could not be so
very much in love with one another. If they were victims
of the desperate passion she had supposed, one
or other or both would give up everything else in the
world. They were both shallow then; and probably
they would do nothing very outrageous. Relief, disappointment,
almost scorn, mingled together in her as she
arrived at this conclusion.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you and Mr. Mead will end by being sensible,"
she said to Ora, with a smile which was less
friendly than she wished it to appear. "You've been
very foolish, but you both seem to see that it can't go
on." She leant forward and looked keenly at Ora.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Ora, put on her defence by this scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Do you really care much about him? I wonder if
you could really care much about anybody!" She was
rather surprised to find herself speaking so openly about
an attachment which her traditions taught her should be
sternly ignored; but she was there to learn what the
woman was like.</p>

<p>"I don't love people often, but I love Ashley," was
Ora's answer; it was given with her own blend of intensity
and innocence. To Irene Bowdon, even armoured
as she was in prejudice, it carried conviction. "It'll
almost kill me to go away from him."</p>

<p>"You'll forget all about him."</p>

<p>"Should I be any happier if I believed that? Should
you be happier for thinking that you'd stop loving your
husband?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>"If I had to lose him&mdash;" Irene began.</p>

<p>"No, no, no," insisted Ora; her eyes were full of
tears. "Oh, you don't understand, how can you understand?
I suppose you think it's Jack? I tell you it
would be the same if Jack had never existed. No, I
don't know. But anyhow it would be the same if he
didn't exist now." She began to walk about the room,
her hands clasped tight on one another.</p>

<p>As she spoke the door opened and Ashley came in.
Irene started, but did not move: she had not wished to
see them together; the sight of their meeting revived
her disapprobation; the thing, being made palpable,
became again offensive to her. But escape was impossible.
Ora seemed entirely forgetful of the presence of
any onlooker; she ran straight to Ashley, crying his
name, and caught him by both his hands. He looked
across at Irene, then raised Ora's hands in his and kissed
each of them. He seemed tired.</p>

<p>"I'm late," he said. "I've had a busy day." He
released Ora and came towards Irene. "They've actually
taken to sending me briefs! How are you, Lady
Bowdon?"</p>

<p>"And the briefs keep him from me," said Ora; she
was standing now in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said with a smile at her. "The world's a
very selfish thing; it wants a big share." He paused
a moment, and went on, "I smell much tobacco; who's
been here?"</p>

<p>"Sidney Hazlewood and Babba," Ora answered.
"They came about the play. They want me to sign
the agreement to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," he said wearily. "They're very persistent
gentlemen. Your husband all right, Lady
Bowdon?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>"Quite, thanks." Irene rose. She had a desire to
get away. She did not follow the lines of the play nor
understand the point of the tragedy; but the sight of
them together made her sure that there was a tragedy,
and she did not wish to see it played. In the first place,
that there should be a tragedy was all wrong, and her
presence must not sanction it; in the second place, the
tragedy looked as if it might be intolerably distressing
and must be utterly hopeless. They would find no way
out; his weariness declared that as plainly as the helplessness
of Ora's puzzled distress. Irene decided to go
home; she would be better there; for although she had
her own little tragedy, she could keep it safely under
lock and key. The secret purpose of her visit stood
accomplished; if she had realised Ora in distress, she
would have sorrowed to send Jack Fenning back to her.
The difference between doing it with sorrow and refusing
to do it altogether was no greater than might be
expected between a woman and men in such a case.
To have got thus far without having seen Mr. Fenning
must stand for an achievement to Lady Bowdon's credit.</p>

<p>Ora let her go without resistance. At the last Irene
was full of friendly feeling, but of feeling that here was
the end of a friendship. By one way or another Ora
was drifting from her; they would not see much more
of one another. Perhaps it had never been natural that
they should see much of one another; atoms from different
worlds, they had met fortuitously; the chance
union yielded now before the dissolving force of their
permanent connexions. But even such meetings leave
results, and Ora, passing out of her friend's life as a
presence, would not be forgotten; she left behind her
the effect that she had had, the difference that she had
made. She could never be forgotten; she would only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[Pg 299]</span>
be unmentioned and ignored; there must be many minutes
in which Irene would think of her and know that
she was in Bowdon's thoughts also. The way of things
seemed to be that people should come into one's life,
do something to it, and then go away again; the coming
was not their fault, what they did seemed hardly
their own doing. She was no longer angry with Ora;
she was sorry for Ora, and she was sorry for herself.
Was there not some wantonness somewhere? Else
why had Ora's raid on her little treasure-house come
about? It had done harm to her, and no good to Ora.
But she kissed Ora with fondness as she left her.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to find you here," said Ashley, as he escorted
her downstairs. "It shews you don't believe the
gossip about her&mdash;about her and me."</p>

<p>Irene turned to him, but made no comment.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know that there's any particular credit
to anybody in the gossip not being true; still as a fact it
isn't true. She hasn't got you here on false pretences."</p>

<p>Irene seemed now not to care whether the gossip
were true or not. She did not get into her carriage,
but detained Ashley on the doorstep.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Haven't you talked about it to Ora?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, but Ora doesn't know what to do." She was
possessed with a longing to tell him that she knew
about Jack Fenning, but her loyalty to Bowdon still
restrained her.</p>

<p>Ashley looked at her; his face struck her again as
being very tired and fretted, but it wore his old friendly
smile; he seemed to take her into his confidence and
to appeal to a common knowledge as he answered her.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know, she'll go to America," he said.
"It'll end in that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>"Does she want to go?" asked Irene.</p>

<p>His eyes dwelt steadily on hers and he nodded his
head. "Yes, she wants to go," he said, smiling still.
"She doesn't know it, poor dear, but she wants to go."</p>

<p>"She'd stop if you told her!" exclaimed Irene impulsively.
How came she to make such a suggestion?
She spent half the evening trying to discover.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so too," he said.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and of course you can't go with her?"</p>

<p>"I shan't go with her," said Ashley. "I can't, if you
like to put it that way."</p>

<p>She pressed him; her curiosity would not be satisfied.</p>

<p>"You don't want to go?" she asked.</p>

<p>His answer was very slow in coming this time, but he
faced the question at last.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I don't want to go." He paused,
glanced at her again, and again smiled. "So, you see,
we shall both have what we really like, and there's no
reason to pity us, is there, Lady Bowdon?"</p>

<p>Then she got into her carriage, and, as she shook
hands with him, she said,</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that you're worse off than a
good many other people."</p>

<p>"I don't know that we are," said Ashley.</p>

<p>And, as she went home, she added that they had
themselves to thank for their troubles, whereas the
greater part of hers could not fairly be laid at her own
door. "If that makes it any better, you know," she
murmured, half aloud.</p>

<p>But perhaps one minded to deal with her as faithfully
as she thought that Ora should be dealt with, might
have observed that not to become Lady Bowdon had
once been a thing in her power.</p>

THE CONTRACT PUNCTILIOUSLY SIGNED BY ALL THE PARTIES, AND WITNESSED BY
JANET THE MAID ... THEY HAD OPENED A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE
</div>

<p>The bargain was struck, the agreement made, the
contract punctiliously signed by all the parties,
and witnessed by Janet the maid. There were two
copies; Mr. Hazlewood had one, Ora the other; Babba
possessed himself of a memorandum. They had opened
a bottle of champagne and drunk success to the enterprise;
prospective triumphs, thousands, fame, bubbled
out into the glasses. Babba was wildly hilarious, and
vulgar with a profusion of debased phrases beyond
even his wont. Mr. Hazlewood smoothed his brow
provisionally; he knew that it must wrinkle again many
times ere the tour was done and the thousands pocketed.
Ora talked very fast, smoked two cigarettes, and darted
to and fro about the room, restless as quicksilver, utterly
refusing to take her seat on the sofa. The arrangements
suspended during her days of indecision could now swiftly
be put in working order; men waited for the word at the
end of cables and telephones across the Atlantic. The
announcements needed only the final touches of Babba's
practised pen; the berths on the boat would be booked
before to-morrow's sun rose. The thing was settled;
beyond all other agreements, this agreement was an
agreement; beyond all other undertakings, this undertaking
bound them all. For they were launched on a
great venture and none could now draw back. It had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[Pg 302]</span>
ended in Ora's consenting to go, as Ashley Mead had
said it would.</p>

<p>Babba Flint and Sidney Hazlewood were gone; Janet,
who also had drunk a glass of champagne, had withdrawn
below again; it was very quiet in the drawing-room of
the little house in Chelsea. Ora was in her seat now,
by the small table, the portrait, and the vase of fresh
roses which from day to day were never wanting. She
lay back there, looking at the ceiling with wide-opened
eyes; she did not move except when her fingers plucked
fretfully at a trimming of lace on her gown; she was
thinking what she had done, what it came to, what it
would end in. She remembered her uncomfortable talk
with Ashley the day before, after Irene had gone, when
he would not say "Sign," nor yet, "For God's sake,
darling, don't sign, don't go, don't leave me;" but
would only smile and say, "You want to go, don't you,
Ora?" She had been able to say neither, "Yes, I want
to go," nor yet, "For all the world I wouldn't leave
you;" but had been perverse and peevish, and at last
had sent him away with a petulant dismissal. But all
the time they both had known that she would sign and
that she would go, because things were setting irresistibly
in that direction and it was impossible to say
No to fate. Fate does not take denials; its invitations
are courteously but persistently renewed. So now she
had signed and she was going.</p>

<p>Of course it meant much more than appeared on the
surface; she had felt that even at the moment, in spite
of Babba's jokes and Hazlewood's business-like attitude.
When she was left alone, the feeling came on her in tenfold
strength; the drama of her action started to light,
its suppressed meaning became manifest, all its effects
unrolled themselves before her. Yet how shortly all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[Pg 303]</span>
could be put; she was going away from Ashley Mead;
the sweet companionship was to be broken. Did such
things come twice, could threads so dropped ever be
picked up again? But all this happened by her own
act. She faced the charge with a denial that there was
more than the most superficial of truths in it. She had
not been able to help her action; it was hers in a sense,
no doubt, but it was the action of a self over which not
she as she knew herself, but this mysterious irresistible
bent of things, held control. And the control was very
tyrannous. Ashley was bound too; for in all the uncomfortable
talk there had been never a suggestion
that he should come with her; for both of them that
had become an impossibility not to be taken into account.
As things would have it, he could not go and
she could not stay. There assailed her such a storm
of fear and horror as had beset her once before, when
her fine scheme of renunciation and reformation was
shattered by the little hard fact that the train drew near
to the station and in ten minutes Ashley would be gone
and Jack Fenning come. She caught Ashley's picture
and kissed it passionately; then she laid her head down
on the cushions and began to sob. She knew now what
she had done; she had driven Ashley out of her life,
and life without him was not worth having. How had
she been so mad as to sign, to deliver herself bound
hand and foot to these men who only wanted to make
money out of her, to think that any triumph could
console her for the loss of her love? Was it too late,
would not a telegram undo all that had been done?
She sat up with a sudden abrupt movement; should
she write one? They might send her to prison, she
supposed, or anyhow make her pay a lot of money.
They would think she used them very badly. Oh, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[Pg 304]</span>
was all that? They could get somebody else to play
her part&mdash;</p>

<p>Why, so they could! Anybody would be glad to
play that part; it might bring new treasure of glory
to the great&mdash;sweet strange fame to one yet unknown.
Ora's sobs were for a moment stayed; she sat looking
straight in front of her.</p>

<p>Ah, how hard things were! How they harassed,
how they tortured, how they tore one asunder! She
lay back and sobbed again, now not so passionately,
but more gently, yet despairingly. So tragic a guise
may sometimes be assumed by such homely truths as
that you cannot blow both hot and cold, that you can't
eat your cake and have it, and that you must in the end
decide whether you will go out by the door or by the
window.</p>

<p>She had told Ashley to come to her again that day
to hear her decision. It was the appointed hour, and
she began to listen for his tread with fear. For he would
think that she did not love him, and she did love him;
he would say that she wanted to go, and she loathed
going; he would tell her all her going meant, and she
knew all it meant. It would be between them as it had
been yesterday, and worse. Alas, that she should have
to fear the sound of Ashley's foot! Ah, that she could
throw herself into his arms, saying, "Ashley, I won't
go!" Then the sweet companionship and days in the
country could come again, all could be forgotten in joy,
and the existence of to-morrow be blotted out.</p>

<p>And Mr. Hazlewood and Babba would get somebody
else to play the part&mdash;the great, great part.</p>

<p>There was the tread. She heard and knew it, and
sat up to listen to it, her lips parted and her eyes
wide; marked it till it reached the very door, but did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[Pg 305]</span>
not rise to meet it. She would sit there and listen to
all that he said to her.</p>

<p>He came in smiling; that seemed strange; he walked
up to her and greeted her cheerily; she glanced at him
in frightened questioning.</p>

<p>"So you've arranged it?" he said, sitting down opposite
to her.</p>

<p>"How do you know, Ashley?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I should know, anyhow," he answered, laughing;
"but I met Babba singing a song in Piccadilly&mdash;rather
loud it sounded&mdash;and he stopped to tell me."</p>

<p>"Oh," she murmured nervously. That he had come
to know in this way seemed an anti-climax, a note
which jarred the tragic harmony; she would have told
him in a tempest of tears and self-reproach.</p>

<p>"You've done quite right," he went on. "It wasn't
a chance to miss. I should have been a selfish brute
if I'd wanted you to give it up. Besides&mdash;" He
smiled and shrugged his shoulders. "Come, Ora," he
went on, "don't look so sorrowful about it."</p>

<p>He was not as he had been the day before; the touch
of mockery which she had seemed to see then was quite
gone. He took her hand and caressed it gently.</p>

<p>"Poor dear," he said, "making up your mind always
upsets you so terribly, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's going away from you," she whispered, and
her grasp fixed tightly on his hand.</p>

<p>"For a few months," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't you think that long?" she cried, her eyes
growing reproachful; she had made up her mind that it
was eternity.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to think it long, and you mustn't
think it long," he said. "The time'll go like lightning.
Get an almanac and ink out the days, as homesick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[Pg 306]</span>
boys do at school; it's quite consoling. And you'll
have so much to do, so much to fill your thoughts."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall jog along till you come back. I shall
be there to meet you then. We'll come up to town
together."</p>

<p>Was this really all? Was there no great, no final
tragedy, after all? So it might seem from his quiet
cheerful manner. Ora was bewildered, in a way disappointed,
almost inclined to be resentful.</p>

<p>"It looks as if you didn't care so very much," she
murmured; she tried to draw her hand away from his,
but he held it fast. He shut his lips close for a moment,
and then said, still very quietly,</p>

<p>"You mustn't think it means that, dear." On the
last word his voice quivered, but he went on again.
"It means a very long night; the sun won't rise again
for ever so many months. But some day it will." She
had turned her head away, and, as he made this confident
declaration, a smile bent his lips for a moment, a
smile not of amusement.</p>

<p>"Will it?" she asked, leaning towards him again,
praying him to repeat his comforting words.</p>

<p>"Of course it will."</p>

<p>"And you won't forget me? Ashley, don't forget
me!"</p>

<p>"Not likely, my dear," said he. "I think Miss Pinsent
makes herself remembered."</p>

<p>"Because I shan't forget you, not for a moment," she
said, fixing her eyes on his. "Oh, it's hard to leave
you!"</p>

<p>She took up her handkerchief from the small table and
dried her eyes. "Your picture will go with me everywhere,"
she said, lightly touching it. "But I shan't be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[Pg 307]</span>
able to have your roses, shall I? Would you like some
tea, Ashley?"</p>

<p>"Very much indeed," said he.</p>

<p>After all, why not tea? There is nothing in tea
necessarily inconsistent with tragedy; still her vague
forecasts of this conversation had not included the taking
of tea.</p>

<p>"Now show me your agreement," he said. "I must
see that they've not done you."</p>

<p>As they had tea, they looked through the contract,
clause by clause. On the whole Ashley was very well
satisfied, although he suggested that one or two points
might be modified in Ora's favour; she quite grasped
what he put forward and thought that she would be
able to obtain the concessions from her partners.</p>

<p>"I ought to make all I can, oughtn't I?" she asked.
"I'm giving up so much to go."</p>

<p>"You ought to be as greedy as you possibly can,"
he assured her with a laugh. He wanted to prevent her
from beginning to talk again of what she was giving
up; what she would gain was a better topic; just as
she must not think how long she would be away, but
on the other hand how soon she would be back. We
cannot control facts, but there is a limited choice of
aspects in which we may regard them and present them
for the consideration of our friends. In this little free
field optimism and pessimism are allowed to play.</p>

<p>"You can always make me happy!" she sighed, leaning
back.</p>

<p>"I know the way to do it, you see," he answered.
He had decided that in this case the best way to do
it was to let her go and play her part.</p>

<p>"Even when you're gone, I shan't be as miserable
as I was before. You've made it all seem less&mdash;less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[Pg 308]</span>
big and less awful, you know. Every day will really be
bringing me nearer to you again; even the first day!
It'll begin directly, won't it? Oh, I shall cry, but now
I shall be able to think of that too."</p>

<p>He was not deceiving her in anything like the grave
manner in which he had deceived her concerning Jack
Fenning, but he felt something of the same qualms.
He did not yield an inch to them externally; he had
made up his mind to cheat her into going happily;
when once that was done, he thought she would soon
grow happy; and if it were to be done, it should be
done thoroughly. A few tears were inevitable, but they
must be alleviated with smiles of hope.</p>

<p>"Directly you go away, you'll begin coming back,
won't you? Really I almost wish you were gone already,
Ora!"</p>

<p>She laughed at this whimsical idea, but agreed that
the actual going would be the one irremediably black
spot. Then she grew grave suddenly, as though an
unwelcome thought had flashed into her mind.</p>

<p>"Ashley," she said, "suppose I&mdash;I meet Jack! He's
over there, you know. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he won't bother you, I expect," Ashley assured
her.</p>

<p>"But if he does? I shan't have you to take care of
me, you know."</p>

<p>"If he does, you go straight to Hazlewood. He's
a good fellow and knows his way about the world.
He'll see you come to no harm and aren't victimised."</p>

<p>"Will he keep Jack away from me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. Take him into your confidence."
Ashley smiled for a moment. "He'll know the sort of
man Fenning is."</p>

<p>Ora seemed a good deal comforted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, I like Sidney Hazlewood," she said. "He's
awfully tiresome sometimes, but you feel that you can
rely on him. He gives you an idea of strength, as if
you could put yourself in his hands. Oh, but not so
much as you do, of course! But then you won't be
there."</p>

<p>"He'll look after you just as well as I should."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will, as far as the actual thing goes," she
admitted. Then she began to smile. "But&mdash;but I
shan't like it so much from him."</p>

<p>"You never know that till you try," said Ashley,
answering her smile with a cheerful smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's absurd," said Ora. "But I do think
he'll stand by me." She leant forward and put her
hand on his knee. "If I were in very, very great
trouble and sent for you, would you come?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ashley, "I'd come then."</p>

<p>"Whatever you had to do? Whatever time it took?
However far off I was?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "Anyhow I'd come. But you
won't&mdash;" He hesitated for a moment. "You won't
have any cause to send for me," he ended.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I should rather like one," she whispered,
almost merrily.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I shall come only if you're in
very, very great trouble; otherwise you must depend on
Hazlewood. But you won't be in trouble, and I don't
think you'll have any bother about Fenning." For
would not Mr. Fenning have the best of reasons for
avoiding observation while Hazlewood was about? To
Hazlewood he was Foster, and Miss Macpherson, by
the dictates of politeness, Mrs. Foster.</p>

<p>It was in entire accord with the line of conduct which
Ashley had laid down for himself that even now he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[Pg 310]</span>
no more of Jack Fenning, and nothing of what he had
done about him or heard about him. He stood aside;
he had determined not to take her life into his hands;
he could not put his into hers; he would not, then,
seek to shape events either for her or for himself;
he would give her no information and urge on her no
course. If she came across her husband, something
would very likely happen; or again it was quite probable
that nothing would occur except an unpleasant interview
and the transference of some of Ora's earnings to Jack's
pocket. Miss Macpherson might appear or she might
not. Ashley had gone as far as he meant to go when
he told Ora to look to Mr. Hazlewood if she were in
any trouble. And if she should chance to want, or
assent to, "nosings" being carried on, why, was not
Babba Flint to be of the party? He dismissed all this
from his mind, so far as he could. It was not part of
Ora, but yet it hung about Ora; he hated it all because
it hung about her, and would intrude sometimes into his
thoughts of her. Why had such sordid things ever
come near her? But they had, and they, as well as
the play and the part, were a fence between her and
him. The bitterness of this conclusion was nothing
new; he had endured it before; he endured it again
as he talked to her and coaxed her into going happily.</p>

<p>But amid all the complexities of reasons, of feelings,
and of choices in which men live, there are moments
when simplicity reasserts itself, and one thing swallows
all others; joy or sorrow brings them. Then the meeting
is everything; or again, there is nothing save the
parting, and it matters nothing why we must part, or
should part, or are parting. Not to be together overwhelms
all the causes which forbid us to be together;
the pain seems almost physical; people cannot sit still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[Pg 311]</span>
when it is on them any more than when they have a
toothache. Such a moment was not to be altogether
evaded by any clever cheating of Ora into going happily.
There were the inevitable tears from her; in him there
was the fierce impulse after all to hold her, not to let
her go, to do all that he was set not to do, by any and
every means to keep her in hearing and sight and touch.
For when she was gone what were touch and hearing
and sight to do? They would all be useless and he,
their owner, useless too. But of this in him she must
see only so much as would assure her of his love and
yet leave her to go happy. That she should go happy
and still not doubt his love was the object at which he
had to aim; the cost was present emptiness of his own
life. But things have to be paid for, whether we are
furnishing our own needs or making presents to our
friends; the ultimate destination of the goods does not
change a farthing in the bill.</p>

<p>His last hour with her seemed to set itself, whether
in indulgence or in irony he could not decide, to focus
and sum up all that she had been to him, to shew all
the moods he knew, the ways he loved, the changes that
he had traced with so many smiles. She wept, she
laughed, she hummed a tune; she took offence and
offered it; she flirted and she prayed for love; she
held him at arm's length, only to fall an instant later
into his arms; she said she should never see him again,
and then decided at what restaurant they would dine
together on the evening of reunion; she waxed enthusiastic
about the part, and then cried that all parts were
the same to her since he would not be in the theatre.
To be never the same was to be most herself. Yet out
of all this variety, in spite of her relapses into tragedy,
the clear conclusion formed itself in his mind that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[Pg 312]</span>
was going happy, at least excited, interested, eager, and
not frightened nor utterly desolate. Yet at the last she
hung about him as though she could not go; and at
the last&mdash;he had prayed that this might be avoided&mdash;there
came back into her eyes the puzzled, alarmed,
doubtful look, and with it the reproach which seemed
to ask him what he was doing with her, to say that after
all it was his act, that he was master, and that when
she gave herself into his hands no profession of abdication
could free him from his responsibility. If it were
so, the burden must be borne; the delusion under which
she went must not be impaired.</p>

<p>The last scene came on a misty morning at Waterloo
Station; it had been decided that he should part from
her there, should hand her over to the men who wanted
to make money out of her, and so go his ways. The
place was full of people; Babba chattered volubly in
the intervals of rushing hither and thither after luggage,
porters, friends, provisions, playing-cards, remembering
all the things he had forgotten, finding that he had
forgotten all that he meant to remember. Hazlewood,
a seasoned traveller, smoked a cigar and read the
morning paper, waiting patiently till his man should put
him in the reserved corner of his reserved carriage;
certainly he looked a calm man to whom one might trust
in a crisis. Ora and Ashley got a few minutes together
in the booking-office, while her maid looked to her
trunks and Babba flew to buy her flowers. Nobody
came near them. Then it was that it seemed as though
the success of his pretence failed in some degree, as
though she also felt something of the sense which
pressed so remorselessly on him, the sense of an end,
that thus they were now together, alone, all in all to
one another, and that thus they would never be again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[Pg 313]</span>
The tears ran down Ora's cheeks; she held both his
wrists in her hands with the old grip that said, "You
mustn't go." She could not speak to him, he found
nothing to say to her; but her tears cried to him, "Are
you right?" Their reproach was bitter indeed, their
appeal might seem irresistible. What now beside them
were parts and plays, lives and their lines, Hazlewoods,
Babba Flints, aye, or Jack Fennings either? They
pleaded for the parlour in the little inn, reminding him
how there first she had thrown herself on his mercy,
asking him whether now for the first time he meant in
very truth to turn cruel and abuse the trust.</p>

<p>But days had passed, and months, since then; with
love had come knowledge, and the knowledge had to
be reckoned with, although it had not destroyed the
love. Was that ungentle? The knowledge was of
himself as well as of her; he dealt no blow that he did
not suffer. The knowledge was, above all, of the way
things were and must be. Therefore in all the stress
of parting he could not, desire it as he might, doubt
that he was right.</p>

<p>Hazlewood raised his voice and called from the platform,
"Off in five minutes, Mead! Hadn't you better
take Miss Pinsent to her carriage?"</p>

<p>"Come, Ora," he said, "you must get in now."</p>

<p>For a moment longer she held his arms.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I shall ever see you again," she said.
Then she dried her eyes and walked with him on to the
platform. Here stood Babba, here Hazlewood, here all
the retinue. Ashley led her up to Hazlewood. "Here
she is," he said; he seemed to be handing her over, resigning
charge of her. The three turned and walked
together to the train.</p>

<p>"You'd rather go down just with your maid, I daresay,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>[Pg 314]</span>
said Hazlewood. "It's time to get in, you know."
He held out his hand to Ashley and then walked away.</p>

<p>"Now, dear," said Ashley Mead.</p>

<p>She gave him her hand. For long he remembered
that last grasp and the clinging reluctance with which it
left him.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Ashley," she said.</p>

<p>"You're beginning to come back from this minute,"
he reminded her, forcing a smile. "As soon as ever
the train moves you're on your way home!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she smiled. "Yes, Ashley." But the charm
of that conceit was gone; the tone was doubtful, sad,
with only a forced recognition of how he meant to cheer
her. Her eyes were more eloquent and more sincere,
more outspoken too in their reproach. "You're sending
me away," they said.</p>

<p>So she went away, looking back out of the window
so long as she could see him; not crying now, but with
a curious, wistful, regretful, bewildered face, as though
she did not yet know what he had done to her, what
had happened, what change had befallen her. This was
the last impression that he had of her as she went to
encounter the world again without the aid to which he
had let her grow so used, without the arm on which he
had let her learn to lean.</p>

<p>But he seemed to know the meaning she sought for,
to grasp the answer to the riddle that puzzled her. As
he walked back through the empty town, back to the
work that must be done and the day that must be lived
through, it was all very clear to him, and seemed as inevitable
as it was clear.</p>

<p>It was an end, that was what it was&mdash;an utter end.</p>

<p>For if it were anything but an end, he had done
wrong. And he had no hope that he had done wrong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[Pg 315]</span>
The chilling sense that he knew only too well the truth
and the right of it was on him; and because he had
known them, he was now alone. Would not blindness
then have been better?</p>

<p>"No, no; it's best to see," said he.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a><span>CHAPTER XXII</span>
<span class="smaller">OTHER WORLDS</span></h2>


<p>Elisha wore worthily the mantle of Elijah; nay,
there were fresh vigour and a new genius in the
management of Muddock and Mead. The turn-over
grew, the percentage of working expenses decreased,
the profits swelled; the branches were reorganised and
made thoroughly up to the needs of the times; the big
block in Buckingham Palace Road advanced steadily in
prestige. For all this the small, compact, trim man with
the keen pale-blue eyes had to be thanked. He had
found a big place vacant; he did not hesitate to jump
up to it, and behold, he filled it! Moreover he knew
that he filled it; the time of promotion was over, the
time of command was come. His quieter bearing and
a self-possession which no longer betrayed incompleteness
by self-assertion marked the change. He did not
now tell people that he made sovereigns while they were
making shillings. He could not give himself grace or
charm, he could not help being still a little hard, rather
too brusque and decisive in his ways; he could not
help people guessing pretty accurately what he was
and whence he came; but the rough edges were filed
and the sharpest points rounded. Even Bowdon, who
was for a number of reasons most prejudiced, admitted
that it was no longer out of the question to ask him to
dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[Pg 317]</span></p>

<p>The business was to be turned into a company; this
step was desirable on many grounds, among them because
it pleased Miss Minna Soames. She was to
marry Bob Muddock, now Sir Robert, and although she
liked Bob and Bob's money she did not care much about
Bob's shop. Neither did Bob himself; he did not want
to work very hard, now that his father's hand was over
him no more, and he thought that a directorship would
both give him less to do and mitigate a relationship to
the shop hitherto too close for his taste. So the thing
was settled, and Bertie Jewett, as Managing Director,
found himself in the position of a despot under forms
of constitutional government. For Bob did as he was
told; and given that a certain event took place, Bertie
would control the larger part of the ordinary shares in
virtue of his own holding, his brother-in-law's, and his
wife's. Preference shares only had been offered to the
public.</p>

<p>The event would take place. Nobody in the circle
of the Muddocks' acquaintance doubted that now, although
perhaps it might not occur very soon. For it
was not the sort of thing which came with a rush; it
depended on no sudden tempest of feeling, it grew
gradually into inevitability. Union of interest, the necessity
of constant meetings, the tendency to lean one
on the other, work slowly, but when they have reached
a certain point of advance their power is great. Bertie
Jewett had not spoken of marriage yet and not for some
time would he; but he had already entered the transaction
on the credit side of his life's ledger. Alice knew
that he had; she did not run away. Here was proof
enough.</p>

<p>"It's not the least use your saying you hope it won't
happen. It will," Lady Bowdon remarked to her husband;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[Pg 318]</span>
and he found it impossible to argue that she was
wrong. For there was no force to oppose the force of
habit, of familiarity, of what her family wanted, of what
the quiet keen little man wanted and meant to have.
Alice was not likely to fall into a sudden, new, romantic
passion; her temper was not of the kind that produces
such things. She had no other wooers; men felt themselves
warned off. Was she then to live unmarried?
This was a very possible end of the matter, but under
the circumstances not the more likely. Then she would
marry Bertie Jewett, unless the past could be undone
and Ashley Mead come again into her heart. But
neither was her temper of the sort that lets the past be
undone; the registers of her mind were written in an ink
which did not fade. Besides he had no thought of
coming back to her.</p>

<p>But there was now, after Ora had gone off with her
play and her part, a revival of friendship between them,
started by a chance encounter at the Bowdons' and
confirmed by a talk they had together when Ashley
called in Kensington Palace Gardens. He was not insensible,
and thought that she was not, to an element
of rather wry comedy which had crept into their relations.
He was sorry for himself, as he had very good
grounds for being; he perceived that she was sorry for
herself and, in view of the dominance and imminence
of Bertie Jewett, fully acknowledged the soundness of
her reasons. The comic side of the matter appeared
when he recognised that, side by side with this self-commiseration,
there existed in each of them an even
stronger pity for the other, a pity that could not claim
to be altogether free from contempt, since it was directed
towards what each of them had chosen, as well as towards
what had chanced to befall them from outside. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[Pg 319]</span>
both been unfortunate, but there was no need to dwell
on that; the more notable point was that whereas he
had chosen to be of Ora Pinsent's party with all which
that implied, she was choosing to be of Bertie Jewett's
party with all which that implied. It was no slur on
their own misfortunes that each would now refuse to
take the others place or to come over to the others
faction. The pity then which each had for the other
was not merely for a state of circumstances accidental
and susceptible of change, but for a habit of mind; they
pitied one another as types even while they came again
to like one another as individuals. For naturally they
over-ran the mark of truth, he concluding that because
she was drifting towards Bertie she was in all things like
Bertie, she that because he had been carried off his feet
by Ora Pinsent he was entirely such as Ora was. There
was certainly something of the comic in this reciprocity
of compassion; it made Ashley smile as he walked
beside Alice in the garden.</p>

<p>"So Bob's going to cut Buckingham Palace Road?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Hardly that. Oh, well, it'll come to something like
that. Minna has aristocratic instincts."</p>

<p>"I remember she had them about the theatre."</p>

<p>"She doesn't like the shop." Alice had been laughing,
but grew grave now as she added, "Do you know,
I get to like the shop more and more. I often go there
and look on while they take stock or something of that
kind. One's in touch with a real life there, there's
something being done."</p>

<p>"I suppose there is," he admitted rather reluctantly.
"I don't in the least object to other people doing it.
However you said from the beginning that it wouldn't
suit me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[Pg 320]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know I did. I think so still." But whether
her reasons were quite the same was more doubtful than
ever. "But I'm quite sure it suits me admirably. I
should like really to work at it."</p>

<p>"Sir James always relied on your opinion about it."</p>

<p>"I suppose he wasn't so wrong as he looked," she
said with a little laugh. "It's in our blood, and I seem
to have a larger share of it than Bob. Why should we
try to get away from it? It's made us what we are."</p>

<p>"You didn't use to think that quite."</p>

<p>"No, and you didn't use to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be quite such a fool as I am? No, I don't think
I did," said Ashley. "Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Still you can't conceive how I can interest myself
so much in the business?"</p>

<p>"Something like that," he admitted. Her phrase
went as near to candour as it was possible for them to
go together. They walked on in silence for a little way,
then Ashley smiled and remarked,</p>

<p>"I believe we get a lot of our opinions simply by
disliking what we see of other people's; we select their
opposites."</p>

<p>"Reaction?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and then we feed what we've picked up till
it grows quite strong."</p>

<p>They fell into silence again. Friendliness could not
banish the sense of distance between them; they could
agree, more or less, as to how they had come to be so
far apart, but the understanding brought them no nearer.
Even agreeing to differ is still differing. Both were
rather sad, yet both were smiling faintly, as they walked
side by side; it was very absurd that they had ever
thought of being so much to one another. Yet it was
a rather sorrowful thing that in future they were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[Pg 321]</span>
so very little to one another. Beneath their differences
they had just enough of kinship to make them regret
that the differences were so great, and so imperative in
the conditions they imposed. A sudden impulse made
Alice turn to him and say,</p>

<p>"I know you think I'm narrow; I hope you don't
think I've been unkind or unfriendly. I did try to put
myself in your place as well as I could; I never thought
unkindly about you."</p>

<p>"How were you to put yourself in my place?" he
asked, smiling at her. "I know you tried. But you'd
have had to put yourself in somebody else's place as
well."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Alice with a shake of her head;
she certainly could not put herself in Ora Pinsent's place.</p>

<p>"After all, people are best in their own places," he
went on. He paused for a moment, and added, "Supposing
they can find out where their places are. You've
found yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "Mine is the shop."</p>

<p>He sighed and smiled, lifting his hands. "I wonder
where mine is," he said a moment later. For if his were
not the shop, it had not seemed to be by Ora Pinsent
either. "Perhaps I haven't got one," he went on.
"And after all I don't know that I want one. Isn't it
possible to keep moving about, trying one after another,
you know?" He spoke lightly, making a jest of his
question; but she had fallen into seriousness.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Work and labour truly to get mine own living. As
for the rest, really I haven't thought about it."</p>

<p>She wanted to ask him whether he still loved Ora
Pinsent, whether he were waiting for her to come back
to him, and still made that the great thing in his life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[Pg 322]</span>
But she could find no words for these questions and no
right in herself to ask them. The unuttered thoughts
served only to check her sympathy for him; even if he
did not look to Ora as the great thing in his future
life, yet she had been so great in his past as to leave
him not caring about the rest. "I'm hard at work,
though," he said an instant after; it sounded as if he
were seeking to defend himself.</p>

<p>Alice said something rather commonplace about the
advantages of hard work; Ashley gave it the perfunctory
assent it seemed to demand. Then came silence,
and to both of them a sense that there was no more to
be said between them.</p>

<p>In spite of this, perhaps because she would not acknowledge
it, Alice asked him to dinner the next night,
to meet the Bowdons and Bertie Jewett; he accepted
with an odd sort of desire to make one of the family
circle once again. His interest was mainly in Bertie;
they sat on either side of Alice. Ashley's contempt for
Bertie was now entirely for the type, and even there not
very severe, for power of any kind extorts respect; it
was in the main supplanted by the curiosity with which
we look on people who are doing what we might have
done had we so chosen, or been allowed by nature so
to choose. There was a moment's pang when he perceived
that Alice was more at ease and more comfortable
in talking to Bertie; he was resigned to the change,
but it was not very pleasant to look on at it in full operation.
Irene, on his other side, allowed none of its significance
to escape him; her glances pointed the moral;
why she did this he could not understand, not tracing
how part of her grudge against Ora attached to the man
who had been so near and so much to Ora, and now
recalled her so vividly to memory. Bowdon was polite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>[Pg 323]</span>
to Lady Muddock, but far from gay. Merriment, animation,
sallies of wit or chaff, a certain amount of what
a hostile critic might call noisiness, had become habitual
to Ashley in the society which he had recently frequented;
he found himself declaring this little party
very dull, overdone with good sense and sobriety, wanting
in irresponsibility of spirit. He hinted something
of this feeling to Irene Bowdon.</p>

<p>"Oh, we don't go in for being brilliant," she said with
a double touch of malice; she meant to hit at Ora and
Ora's friends, and also perversely to include herself in
his hinted depreciation of the company; this she liked
to do because the depreciation came, as she knew, from
a recollection of Ora and Ora's sort of society.</p>

<p>"Being brilliant isn't in itself a crime," pleaded
Ashley; "even if it were, it's so rare that there's no
need for an exemplary sentence."</p>

<p>"Why don't you talk to Alice?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"She prefers to talk to Mr. Jewett."</p>

<p>"I'm glad it annoys you."</p>

<p>"Are you? I'm rather surprised it does. I don't
know why it should, you see."</p>

<p>Irene turned her shoulder on him with emphasised
impatience. What right had he to find it dull? Did
Bowdon also find it dull? Then came the worst irritation&mdash;the
admission that it was dull. She turned back
to Ashley with a sudden twist.</p>

<p>"What right have you to expect to be always
amused?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"None; but I suppose I may mention it when I'm
not," said he.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you remind me of? You'll be
angry if I tell you."</p>

<p>"Then I couldn't deprive you of the pleasure of telling
me, Lady Bowdon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>"You're like a drunkard put on lemonade," she said
with a vicious little laugh.</p>

<p>Ashley made no immediate answer; he looked at her
with lifted brows; then he also laughed.</p>

<p>"The metaphor's rather strong," said he, "but&mdash;if
you like!"</p>

<p>"Well, you're very good-tempered," she conceded
with a remorseful glance. "I should feel better if you'd
hit me back."</p>

<p>"I've no weapon."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have." Her tone was marked and significant;
he looked straight and attentively in her face;
her eyes were not on his watching face but on her husband
whose head was bent in courteous attention to
Lady Muddock's doubtfully expounded platitudes.</p>

<p>"Look here, do you know anything?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said she without turning towards him.</p>

<p>He grew surer of his ground and hazarded his shot
with confidence.</p>

<p>"About a thousand pounds?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah, married men, married men! It wasn't his
secret. And why in heaven's name did he tell you?"</p>

<p>"He was right to tell me. I like the truth."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk about truth! I'm fresh from a surfeit
of it. I shouldn't have thought it made you any
more&mdash;" He paused, in difficulty how to say enough
and not too much.</p>

<p>"Any happier to know?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if you like," said Ashley, again accepting
her phrase.</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't," she said briefly. Then she added,
"I promised not to tell you; don't let him know I
have."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>[Pg 325]</span></p>

<p>"I'll try to prove a better confidant than he is," said
Ashley. "And why did you tell me?"</p>

<p>"You half guessed. I didn't tell. But&mdash;don't you
think we might sympathise a little?"</p>

<p>"We'll sympathise all we can," said Ashley with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"We might almost all sympathise; she's made a
difference to almost all of us."</p>

<p>"Who has?"</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she&mdash;she," said Irene Bowdon, as she rose
in answer to her hostess' signal.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, she has," Ashley admitted, as he drew
back the chairs. And while she was still in earshot he
added, "But it's all over now."</p>

<p>"Indeed it isn't, it never will be," said Irene over her
shoulder, as she swept away.</p>

<p>"How ready people are with these eternal negatives,"
he thought as he sat down to his glass of wine.</p>

<p>Then he fell to speculating why Bowdon had told her
about Jack Fenning and the thousand pounds, and why
she had revealed that Bowdon had told her. To him
the second question seemed the more difficult to answer,
but he found an explanation, partly in her desire to
defend or apologise for a certain bitterness towards
Ora which she had betrayed, more perhaps in the
simple fact that she was brimming over with the thing
and could not restrain herself in the presence of one to
whom her disclosure would be so interesting and significant.
She had been tempted to show him that she
knew more of the situation than he supposed, and must
not be treated as an outsider when Ora and her affairs
came up for discussion. Anyhow there the disclosure
was, with its proof that, even although the eternal negative
might be rashly asserted, for the time at all events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>[Pg 326]</span>
Ora had very materially affected other lives than his
own.</p>

<p>"Of course I never expected to be where I am; at
any rate not till much later."</p>

<p>Bertie Jewett was talking to Bowdon about his success
and his new position; he talked unaffectedly enough,
although perhaps it could hardly be said that he talked
modestly. Perceiving that his remark had roused Ashley
to attention, he went on, "Among other things, I've
got to thank your dislike of a commercial life, Mead.
That let me in, you see."</p>

<p>"Come, Ashley," laughed Bowdon, "here's something
to your credit!"</p>

<p>"Really the exact train of circumstances that has
resulted in putting me practically at the head of the
concern is rather curious to consider," pursued Bertie.
Bowdon listened with a tolerant, Ashley with a malicious
smile. "It all seemed to be made so easy for me.
I had only to wait, and all the difficulties cleared out of
the way. I can talk of it because I had nothing to do
with it, except taking what I was offered, I mean."</p>

<p>"Well, everybody's not equal to that, by any means,"
said Bowdon. "But certainly fortune's treated you
well."</p>

<p>It was on Ashley's lips to say "You owe it all to Ora
Pinsent." But the thing would have been absurd and
quite inadmissible to say. Perhaps it was also rather
absurd to think; he knew the trick he had of magnifying
and extending his own whimsical view of events until
it seemed to cover the whole field. None the less, an
intimate knowledge of the circumstances, of the exact
train of circumstances as Bertie put it, forbade him to
rob Miss Pinsent of all credit for the result on which he
and Bowdon were congratulating Mr. Jewett. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>[Pg 327]</span>
should not poor Ora, towards whom so many people
were bearing a grudge, have gratitude when she deserved
it?</p>

<p>"The fact is," said Bowdon, tugging his moustache,
"things happen very queerly in this world."</p>

<p>"After that startling observation, let's go into the
garden and smoke," said Ashley, rising with a laugh.</p>

<p>In the garden Ashley talked to Lady Muddock, and
had the opportunity of observing how a seventh heaven
of satisfaction might be constructed without a single
scrap of material which seemed to him heavenly. Such
a spectacle should serve as a useful corrective for a judgment
of the way of the world too personal and relative
in character; it had on Ashley the perverse effect of
increasing his discontent. If happiness were so easy
a thing and placidity so simply come by, if nothing extraordinary
were needed for them and nothing dazzling
essential, why, what fools were people who went after
the extraordinary and the dazzling, and yet in the end
failed completely in their quest! And that you were
a fool by your very nature was no comfort, but rather
increased the hopelessness of the position.</p>

<p>"I can't help thinking how wonderfully everything
has happened for the best," said Lady Muddock, her
eyes resting on Alice and Bertie who were walking side
by side, a few paces behind Bowdon and his wife.</p>

<p>"You're rather too optimistic for me," said Ashley
with a laugh. "I think we do the world rough justice
if we admit that most things happen for the second-best."</p>

<p>"We are taught&mdash;" Lady Muddock began.</p>

<p>"Yes, but, my dear Lady Muddock, we're most of us
shocking bad pupils."</p>

<p>Lady Muddock made a few efforts to convert him to
the creed of the best, in distinction from that of the second-best;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>[Pg 328]</span>
but Ashley would not be persuaded. The
idea of the second-best gained on him. What had happened
to the little circle about him was certainly not
ideal, yet it was not calamity; it could hardly claim to
be tragedy, yet you were in danger of being brought up
short by some sudden pang if you tried to laugh at it.
It wanted then a formula to express its peculiar variety,
its halting midway between prosperity and misfortune,
between what one would have wished and what one
might have had to take. The formula of the second-best
seemed to suit it very well. Even his own individual
position, of which he had not taken a sanguine
view, fitted itself into the formula with just a little pressing
and clipping and management. His life was not
ruined; he found himself left with too many interests
and ambitions, with too keen an appreciation of all that
was going on about him, to yield to the hysteria of such
a sentimental conclusion; but it was not, and now would
not be, quite what he had once dreamed and even lately
hoped. He took courage and decided that he need not
fall below the formula of the second-best. And what of
Ora? Would she also and her life fit into the formula?
She had never fitted into any formula yet; here lay her
charm, the difficulty and the hopelessness of her. But
then the new formula was very elastic. She might find
a second-best for herself, or accept one if it were offered
to her.</p>

<p>In the notion that he has learnt or begun to learn the
ways of the world and how to take it there lies a subtle
and powerful appeal to a man's vanity. There is a
delicate flavour in the feeling, surpassing the more
obvious delights which may be gained from the proof
of intellectual superiority or the consciousness of personal
charm. It is not only that the idea makes him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[Pg 329]</span>
seem wiser than his fellows, for the conviction of greater
wisdom would not appear to carry much pleasure; it
makes him feel better-tempered, better-mannered, better-bred&mdash;if
it may so be put, more of a gentleman. He is
no longer one of the pushing jostling throng, eager to
force a way into the front places, to have the best view
of the show or the largest share of the presents which
are to be distributed; he stands on the outskirts in cool
leisureliness, smiling rather superciliously, not exactly
happy, but convinced that any effort would turn his
negative condition into a positive discomfort. Or the
old metaphor of the banquet comes back into his mind;
when the dish goes round he does not snatch at it; if
it is long in coming, he feels and betrays no impatience;
if it is finished before it reaches him, he waits for the
next course, and meanwhile engages in polite conversation;
he does not call out, nor make gestures, nor abuse
the waiters (they are great folk in disguise). The rest
of the company, who do all these things, commit gross
breaches of taste; and although he may go home
hungry he will be fed and warmed by the satisfaction
of his graceful attitude and the glow of his suavity. Of
course graceful attitudes are a little tiring and suavity
is always more or less of a mask, but here it is that
good-breeding finds its field and rewards him who displays
it with its peculiar guerdon. Perhaps he would
have liked the presents or the dishes, and he has not
got them; but then his coat is not torn, his shirt is not
crumpled, his collar is not limp. The successful betray
all these unbecoming signs of a triumph in reality disgraceful;
how have they the audacity to exhibit themselves
red-faced, puffing, perspiring, hugging their prizes
to their breasts and casting round furtive suspicious
glances, fearful that they may still be robbed? Surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>[Pg 330]</span>
the vulgarity of the means sticks to the end and soils
that also?</p>

<p>Here were very ingenious arguments to prove that
the second-best was in a true view the best; so treated
and managed, the formula should surely assume new
attractions?</p>

<p>But if a man be very hungry? The argument is not
fairly put. He gets fed, though not on his favourite
delicacy. But if he cannot eat rough fare? Well, in
that case, so much the worse for him; he should not
have a dainty stomach.</p>

<p>It is a long way from Kensington Palace Gardens to
Charing Cross; there is time for many philosophical
reflexions as a man walks from one to the other on a
fine night. But at the end, when he has arrived, should
his heart beat and his hand dart out eagerly at the sight
of an envelope bearing an American postage stamp?
Does such a paradox impugn his conclusions or merely
accuse his weakness? Human nature will crop out,
and hunger is hunger, however it may be caused. Perhaps
these backslidings must be allowed; they come
only now and then; they will not last, will at least come
more seldom. The emptiness will not always vent
angry abuse on the good manners which are the cause
of it.</p>

<p>The letter was a long one, or looked long because it
covered many pages&mdash;it was understamped, a circumstance
prettily characteristic&mdash;but Ora wrote large, and
there was not really a great deal in it. What there was
was mostly about the play and the part, the flattering
reception, the killing work, the unreasonableness of
everybody else. All this was just Ora, Ora who was
neither to be approved of, nor admired, nor imitated,
but who was on no account to be changed. Ashley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>[Pg 331]</span>
read with the same smile which had shewn itself on his
face when he commended the formula of the second-best
to Lady Muddock's candid consideration. He
came near the end. Would there be no touch of the
other Ora, of his own special secret Ora, the one he
knew and other people did not? There was hardly a
touch; but just on the last page, just before the "yours,
Ora," there came, "Oh, my dear, if only you were with
me! But I seem to have got into another world. And
I'm lonely, Ashley dear."</p>

<p>The great clock down at Westminster struck one, the
hum of the town ran low, the little room was quiet.
Perhaps moments like these are not the fittest for the
formula of the second-best. Does it not, after all, need
an audience to smile pleased and appreciative applause
of it? Is it as independent, as grandly independent, as
it sounds? Does it comfort a man when he is quite
alone? Is it equal to fighting the contrasts between
what is and what might have been?</p>

<p>"I seem to have got into another world. And I'm
lonely, Ashley dear."</p>

<p>Heavens, how many worlds were there, that all his
friends should be getting into others and leaving him
alone in his?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a><span>CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<span class="smaller">THE MOST NATURAL THING</span></h2>


<p>By reason of the Government's blunders or of the
Opposition's factiousness&mdash;the point awaits the
decision of a candid historian in case he should deem
it worth his attention&mdash;Parliament had to assemble
in the autumn of this year; the Bowdons were back
in town in November, the Commission met to wind up
its work, and Ashley Mead was in dutiful attendance.
Before this Irene had made up her mind that things were
going tolerably, would go better, and in the end would
turn out as well as could reasonably be expected. The
recuperative effect of a vagrant autumn had produced
a healthier state of feeling in her. She had begun to
be less fretful about herself, less nervous and inquisitive
about her husband; she had resigned herself to
the course of events in a hopeful temper. Bowdon's
bearing towards her was all that she could desire; it
was losing that touch of exaggerated chivalry which
had smacked of apology and remorse; it was assuming
the air of a genuine and contented comradeship. She
was inclined to think that their troubles were over. If
one or two other things were over with the troubles,
the principle of compensation must be accepted manfully.
After all, love's alternate joy and woe is not the
stuff to make a permanently happy home or the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>[Pg 333]</span>
setting for a useful public career; on the other hand, these
can co-exist with a few memories of which one does
not speak and a cupboard or two kept carefully locked.</p>

<p>Having brought herself to this point, and feeling both
praiseworthy and sensible in attaining so much, she
allowed herself some astonishment at Ashley Mead, who
seemed to have started in an even worse condition and
yet to have achieved so much more. He appeared to
have passed a complete Act of Oblivion for himself,
and to have passed it with a rapidity which (from one
or other of the reasons above referred to) would have
been quite impossible to the Legislature. Surely in
him, if in anybody, the period of convalescence should
have been long? Resolution is good, so is resignation,
so are common-sense and strength of will; but there
is a decency in things, and to recover too quickly from
a folly confirms the charge of levity and instability incurred
by its original commission. Ashley should not
be behaving just for all the world as though nothing
had happened; such conduct was exasperating to persons
who had reason to know and to feel how much
really had happened. To be cheerful, to be gay, to
be prospering greatly, to be dining out frequently, to
have suppressed entirely all hint of emotions lately so
acute and even overpowering, was not creditable to him,
and cheated his friends of a singularly interesting subject
for observation and comment, as well as of a sympathetic
melancholy to which they had perhaps allowed
themselves to look forward. It was no defence that
Irene herself aimed at what he appeared to have
achieved, as at a far-off ideal; she had not been, to the
knowledge of all London, desperately in love with Ora
Pinsent; she had not thrown up brilliant business prospects,
lost an admirable match, and seriously impaired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>[Pg 334]</span>
her reputation in the eyes of all respectable people.
Neither had she bribed Jack Fenning to go away at the
cost of a thousand pounds.</p>

<p>"Surely all men aren't like that?" she cried with
marked indignation.</p>

<p>She broke out on Ashley once when he came to tea
and they chanced to be alone; he met her in a way
which increased her annoyance.</p>

<p>"Well, what has happened after all?" he asked,
leaning back in his chair and smiling at her. "I don't
see that anything has. Ora has gone on a visit to
America; from what I hear, a very successful visit.
Presently, I suppose, she'll come back. A visit to
America doesn't in these days mean a final separation
from all one holds dear in the old country. I believe
one almost always finds the man who lives next door
in London dining at the same table in New York; then
one makes his acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Do you ever hear from her? I never do."</p>

<p>"I hear from her every now and then. Oh, I admit
at once what your look means; yes, not so often as at
first." He laughed at the flush of vexation on Lady
Bowdon's face. "I write seldomer too; I can do anything
for a friend except carry on a correspondence."</p>

<p>"I expect every day to hear of Alice Muddock's
engagement."</p>

<p>"Do you really think about it every day?" he asked,
raising his brows. "What an eye you keep on your
acquaintances!"</p>

<p>Was he genuine? Or was he only perfectly, coolly,
securely on his guard? Irene felt baffled and puzzled;
but it was bad enough that he should be able even to
pretend so well to her; pretending that nothing had
happened was not always easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>[Pg 335]</span></p>

<p>"Do you think Ora will come back?" she asked.
"If she's successful she may stay."</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll come," he nodded. "We shall have her
back in Chelsea before six months are out."</p>

<p>"And when she does?"</p>

<p>Irene's curiosity had overcome her, but Ashley laughed
again as he answered, "Ascribe what emotions you like
to me, Lady Bowdon; but I haven't heard that Jack
Fenning's health's failing."</p>

<p>There was some pretence about the attitude so puzzling
and exasperating to Irene Bowdon, but more of
reality. The passing of the months had brought a sense
of remoteness; it was intensified by a gradual cessation
of the interchange of letters. Ora had told him
that she seemed to have got into another world and was
lonely; she was, without doubt, still in another world;
whether still lonely he could not tell. She was in all
senses a long way off; what he had chosen, or at least
accepted as the lesser evil, was happening; she and her
life were diverging from him and his life. He recognised
all this very clearly as he ate his chop at the club
that evening. She had found him living one life; she
had given him another while she was with him; she left
him a third different from either of the other two. That
evening, whether from some mood of his own or because
of what Irene had said, she seemed irrevocably
departed and separated from him. But even in that
hour she was to come back to him so as to be very near
in feeling though still across the seas in fact.</p>

<p>As he turned into his street about ten o'clock and approached
the door of his house, he perceived a man
walking slowly up and down, to and fro. There was
something familiar in the figure and the gait; an indecision,
a looseness, a plaintive weakness. Unconsciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>[Pg 336]</span>
Ashley quickened his step; he had a conviction
which seemed absurd and was against all probability; a
moment would prove or disprove its truth. The man
came under the gas lamp, stopped, and looked up at
Ashley's windows. His face was plain to see now.
"By God, it is!" whispered Ashley Mead, with a
frown and a smile. A little more slinking, a little more
slouching, a little more altogether destitute of the air
which should mark a self-respecting man, but unchanged
save for these intensifications of his old characteristics,
Jack Fenning stood and looked up at
the house whence he had once come out richer
by a thousand pounds than when he went in. He
seemed to regard the dingy old walls with a maudlin
affection.</p>

<p>It was a pretty bit of irony that she should come back
in this way; that this aspect of her, this side of her
life, should be thrust before Ashley's eyes when all that
he loved of her and longed for was so far away. Ashley
walked up to Jack Fenning with lips set firm in a stiff
smile.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Fenning, what brings you here?" he
asked. "I've no more thousands about me, you
know."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought you might give me a drink for old
friendship," said Jack. "They said you were out, and
wouldn't let me sit in your room. So I said I'd come
back; but I've been waiting all the time."</p>

<p>"If you don't mind what the drink's for, I'll give it
you. Come along." He loathed the man, but because
the man in a sense belonged to Ora he would not turn
him away; curiosity, too, urged him to find out the
meaning of an appearance so unexpected. With Ora
in America, how could it profit Jack to make a nuisance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>[Pg 337]</span>
of himself in England? There was nothing to be got
by that.</p>

<p>When they were upstairs and Jack had been provided
with the evidence of friendship which he desired, Ashley
lit his pipe, sat down by the fire, and studied his companion
in silence for a few moments. Jack grew a little
uncomfortable under the scrutiny; he was quite aware
that he did not and could not stand investigation. But
Ashley was thinking less of him than of what he represented.
He had been just one of those stupid wanton
obstacles, in themselves so unimportant, which serve to
wreck fair schemes; he seemed to embody the perversity
of things, and to make mean and sordid the fate
that he typified.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" Ashley asked suddenly and
abruptly. "I've got no more money for you, you
know."</p>

<p>No doubt Jack was accustomed to this style of reception.
It did not prevent him from telling his story.
He lugged out a cheap broken-backed cigar from his
breast-pocket and lit it; it increased the feeble disreputableness
of his appearance.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you all about it, Mr. Mead," he said. "It
may be worth your while to listen." But the sudden
confidence of these last words died away quickly. "I
hope to God you'll do something for me!" he ended in
a whining voice.</p>

<p>This man was Ora Pinsent's husband.</p>

<p>"Go on," muttered Ashley, his teeth set hard on the
stem of his pipe.</p>

<p>The story began, but proceeded very haltingly; Ashley
had to draw it out by questions. The chief point
of obscurity was as regards Jack's own intentions and
motives. Why he had come to England remained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>[Pg 338]</span>
vagueness; Ashley concluded that the memory of the
thousand pounds had drawn him with a subtle retrospective
attraction, although reason must have told him
that no second thousand would come. But on the matter
of his grievances and the sad treatment he had suffered
from others Jack was more eloquent and more lucid.
Everybody was against him, even his wife Ora Pinsent,
even his own familiar friend Miss Daisy Macpherson.
For Miss Macpherson had deserted him, had gone
over to the enemy, had turned him out, and for lucre's
sake had given information to hostile emissaries. And
his wife ("My own wife, Mr. Mead," said Jack mournfully)
was trying to get rid of him for good and all.</p>

<p>Ashley suddenly sat up straight in his seat as the
narrative reached this point.</p>

<p>"To get rid of you? What do you mean?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"There's a fellow named Flint&mdash;" said Jack between
gulps at his liquor.</p>

<p>Of course there was! A fellow who did not despise
nosings! That bygone talk with Babba leapt lifelike
to Ashley's mind.</p>

<p>The fellow named Flint, aided by the basest treachery
on the part of Miss Macpherson&mdash;why had she not
denied all compromising facts?&mdash;had landed Mr. Fenning
in his present predicament.</p>

<p>"What in the world is it you mean?" groaned Ashley.</p>

<p>"They've begun divorce proceedings," said Jack, with
a desperate pull at the broken-backed leaky cigar. "My
own wife, Mr. Mead."</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, you're a much-wronged man," said
Ashley.</p>

<p>In the next few moments he came near to repenting
his sarcastic words. Repentance would indeed have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>[Pg 339]</span>
been absurd; but if every one were kicking the creature
it was hard and needless to add another kick. He found
some sorrow and disapprobation for the conduct of Miss
Daisy Macpherson; it was ungrateful in her who had
liked to be known as Mrs. Foster in private life.</p>

<p>"Babba Flint got round your friend, did he?" he
asked. "Well, I suppose you've no defence?"</p>

<p>"I've got no money, Mr. Mead."</p>

<p>"That's the same thing, you know," said Ashley.
"Well, what's the matter? How does it hurt you to be
divorced?"</p>

<p>"I never tried to divorce her," moaned Jack.</p>

<p>"Never mind your conduct to your wife; we can
leave that out."</p>

<p>"I was very fond of Miss Pinsent; but she was hard
to me."</p>

<p>"I've nothing to do with all that. What do you
want to resist the divorce for?" His tone was savage;
how dare this creature tell him that he had been very
fond of Ora Pinsent? Must her memory be still more
defiled? Should he always have to think of this man
when he thought of her? Jack shrank lower and lower
in his chair under the flash of severity; his words died
away into confused mutterings; he stretched out his
hand towards the whiskey bottle.</p>

<p>"You're half drunk already," said Ashley. Jack
looked at him for an instant with hazy eyes, and then
poured out some liquor; Ashley shrugged his shoulders;
his suggested reason had, he perceived, no validity.
Jack drank his draught and leant forward towards
his entertainer with a fresh flicker of boldness.</p>

<p>"I know what their game is, Mr. Mead," he said.
"Daisy let it all out when we had our row."</p>

<p>"Whose game?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a>[Pg 340]</span></p>

<p>"Why, Ora's, and that damned Flint's, and Hazlewood's."</p>

<p>"Will you oblige me in one point? If you will, you
may have some more whiskey. Tell the story without
mentioning Miss Pinsent."</p>

<p>Jack smiled in wavering bewilderment. Why shouldn't
he mention Ora? He took refuge in an indeterminate
"They," which might or might not include his wife.</p>

<p>"They mean to get rid of me, then their way's clear,"
he said with a nod.</p>

<p>"Their way to what?"</p>

<p>"To marrying her to Hazlewood," said Jack with a
cunning smile. He waited an instant; his smile grew a
little broader; he took another gulp. "What do you
say to that, Mr. Mead?" he asked.</p>

<p>Several moments passed, Jack still wearing his cunning
foolish smile, Ashley smoking steadily. What did
he say to that? Babba had offered him the service of
nosings; would he not, in an equally liberal spirit, put
them at the disposal of Mr. Hazlewood? Hazlewood
was a good fellow, but he would not be squeamish about
the nosings. So far there was no improbability. But
Ora? Was she party to the scheme? Well, she would
gladly&mdash;great heavens, how gladly!&mdash;be rid of this
creature; and the other thing would be held in reserve;
it would not be pressed on her too soon. The same
mixture of truth and pretence which had marked his
talk with Irene Bowdon displayed itself in his answer to
Jack Fenning.</p>

<p>"The most natural thing in the world," he said, with
a shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>Jack's face fell, disappointment and dismay were
painted on it. His next remark threw some light on
the hopes which had brought him to England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>[Pg 341]</span></p>

<p>"I thought you'd be obliged to me for the tip," he
said mournfully.</p>

<p>Tips and nosings&mdash;nosings and tips!</p>

<p>"Good God, have you any notion at all of the sort of
creature you are?" asked Ashley.</p>

<p>Jack giggled uncomfortably. "We're none of us
perfect," he said. "I don't see that I'm worse than
other people." He paused, and added again, "I
thought you'd be obliged to me, Mr. Mead."</p>

<p>Ashley had fallen to thinking; now he asked one
question.</p>

<p>"Does Miss Pinsent know you came here before?"</p>

<p>"Daisy gave away the whole thing," murmured Jack
forlornly. "All about my being here and what you
did; and Hazlewood saw me here, you know." He
paused again, and resumed, "It's all pretty rough on
me; I don't want to be troublesome, but they ought to
do something for me."</p>

<p>"And they wouldn't, so you came to me?"</p>

<p>Jack wriggled about and finished his glass.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't, either," said Ashley.</p>

<p>"I've only got thirty shillings. There's a cousin of
mine in Newcastle who might do something for me if I
had a bit of money, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What have you done with the thousand?"</p>

<p>"Daisy clawed the lot," moaned Mr. Fenning.</p>

<p>It was surely a delusion which made Ashley feel any responsibility
for the man; he had no doubt prevented Jack
from rejoining his wife, but no good could have come of
the reunion. Nevertheless, on the off-chance of there
being a moral debt due, he went to the drawer of his
writing-table and took out two bank-notes. It occurred
to him that the proceeding was unfair to the cousin in
Newcastle, but in this world somebody must suffer. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>[Pg 342]</span>
held out the notes to Jack. "Go," he said. Jack's
eyes glistened as he darted out his hand. "Never
come back. By heaven, I'll throw you downstairs if
you ever come back."</p>

<p>Jack laughed weakly as he looked at the notes and
thrust them into his pocket. He rose; he could still
stand pretty steadily. "You understand? Never come
back or&mdash;the stairs!" said Ashley, standing opposite
to him and smiling at him.</p>

<p>"I won't trouble you again, Mr. Mead," Jack assured
him.</p>

<p>"It's a case where the trouble would be a pleasure,
but don't come all the same. You'd be a poor sort of
man to be hanged for, you know."</p>

<p>Jack laughed more comfortably; he thought that he
was establishing pleasant relations; but he was suddenly
relegated to fright and dismay, for Ashley caught
him by the shoulder and marched him quickly to the
door, saying, "Now, get out." Jack glanced round in
his face. "All right, I'm going, I'm going, Mr. Mead,"
he muttered. "Don't be angry, I'm going." He darted
hastily through the door and stood for one instant at
the top of the stairs, looking back over his shoulder
with a scared expression. Ashley burst into a laugh
and slammed the door; the next moment he heard
Jack's shuffling steps going down.</p>

<p>"I must have looked quite melodramatic," he said as
he flung himself down on his sofa. His heart was beating
quick and the sweat stood on his brow. "Good
God, what an ass I am!" he thought. "But I only
just kept my hands off the fellow. How infernally absurd!"
He got up again, relit his pipe, and mixed
himself some whiskey-and-water. His self-respect demanded
an immediate and resolute return to the plane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>[Pg 343]</span>
of civilised life; an instinct to throw Jack Fenning downstairs,
combined with a lively hope that his neck would
be broken, was not civilised.</p>

<p>And was it grateful? His stiff smile came again as
he declared that he ought to consider himself obliged
to Jack and that the bank-notes were no more than a
proper acknowledgment of services rendered. Jack's
reappearance and Jack's news gave the fitting and necessary
cap to the situation; they supplied its demands
and filled up its deficiencies, they forbade any foolish
attempt to idealise it, or to shut eyes to it, or to kick
against the pricks. He had elected to have nothing to
do with nosings; then he could not look to enjoy the
fruits of nosing. The truth went deeper than that; he
had been right in his calm bitter declaration that the
thing of which Jack came to warn him was the most
natural thing in the world. Ora, being in another world
and being lonely, turned to the companionship her new
world gave; like sought like. The thing, while remaining
a little difficult to imagine&mdash;because alien memories
crossed the mirror and blurred the image&mdash;became more
and more easy to explain on the lines of logic, and to
justify out of his knowledge of the world, of women and
of men. It was natural, indeed he caught the word
"inevitable" on the tip of his tongue. The whole affair,
the entire course of events since Ora Pinsent had
come on the scene, was of a piece; the same laws ruled,
the same tendencies asserted themselves; against their
sway and their force mere inclinations, fancies, emotions,
passions&mdash;call them what you would&mdash;seemed
very weak and transient, stealing their moment of noisy
play, but soon shrinking away beaten before the steady
permanent strength of these opponents. The problem
worked out to its answer, the pieces fitted into the puzzle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>[Pg 344]</span>
until the whole scheme became plain. As Bowdon
to his suitable wife, as Alice Muddock to her obvious
husband, so now Ora Pinsent to the man who was so
much in her life, so much with her, whose lines ran
beside her lines, converging steadily to a certain point
of meeting. Yes, so Ora Pinsent to Sidney Hazlewood.
It would be so; memories of days in the country, of
inn parlours, of sweet companionship, could not hinder
the end; the laws and tendencies would have their way.
The sheep had tried to make a rush, to escape to
pleasant new browsing-grounds, the dog was on them
in an instant and barked them back to their proper pens
again.</p>

<p>"Only I don't seem to have a pen," said Ashley
Mead.</p>

<p>When a thing certainly is, it is perhaps waste of time
to think whether it is for the best, and what there may
be to be said for and against it. But the human mind
is obstinately plagued with a desire to understand and
appreciate things; it likes to feel justified in taking up
an amiable and acquiescent attitude towards the world
in which it finds itself, it does not love to live in rebellion
nor even in a sullen obedience. Therefore Ashley
tried to vindicate the ways of fate and to declare that
the scheme which was working itself out was very good.
Even for himself probably a pen would be indicated
presently, and he would walk into it. On a broader view
the pen-system seemed to answer very well and to produce
the sort of moderate happiness for which moderately
sensible beings might reasonably look. That was the
proper point of view from which to regard the matter;
anything else led to an uncivilised desire to throw
Jack Fenning downstairs.</p>

<p>Thus Jack Fenning vanished, but in the next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>[Pg 345]</span>
or two there came the letter from Ora, the letter which
was bound to come in view of the new things she had
learnt. Ora was not exactly angry, but she was evidently
puzzled. She gave him thanks for keeping Jack
away from her, out of her sight and her knowledge.
"But," she wrote, "I don't understand about afterwards;
because you found out from Mr. Hazlewood
things that might have made, oh, all the difference,
if you'd told them to me and if you'd wanted them
to. I don't understand why you didn't tell me; we
could have done what's being done now and I should
have got free. Didn't you want me free? I can't and
won't think that you didn't really love me, that you
wouldn't really have liked to have me for your own.
But I don't know what else I can think. It does look
like it. I wish I could see you, Ashley, because I
think I might perhaps understand then why you acted
as you did; I'm sure you had a reason, but I can't see
what it was. When we were together, I used to know
how you thought and felt about things, and so perhaps,
if we were together now, you could make me understand
why you treated me like this. But we're such a
long way off from one another. Do you remember saying
that I should begin to come back as soon as ever I
went away, and that every day would bring me nearer to
you again? It isn't like that; you get farther away.
It's not only that I'm not with you now, but somehow
it comes to seem as if I'd never been with you&mdash;not
as we really were, so much together. And so I
don't know any more how you feel, and I can't understand
how you did nothing after what you found out
from Mr. Hazlewood. Because it really would have
made all the difference. I don't want to reproach you,
but I just don't understand. I shall be travelling about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>[Pg 346]</span>
a lot in the next few weeks and shan't have time to
write many letters. Good-bye."</p>

<p>It was what she must think, less by far than she
might seem to have excuse for saying. He had no
answer to it, no answer that he could send to her,
no answer that he could carry to her, without adding a
sense of hurt to the bewilderment that she felt. Of
course too she forgot how large a share the play and
the part, with all they stood for, had had in the separation
and distance between them which she deplored as
so sore a barrier to understanding. She saw only that
there had been means by which Jack Fenning might
have been cleared out of the way, means by which he
was in fact now being cleared out of the way, and that
Ashley had chosen to conceal them from her and not
to use them himself. Hence her puzzled pain, and her
feeling that she had lost her hold on him and her knowledge
of his mind. Reading the letter, he could not
stifle some wonder that her failure to understand was
so complete. He would not be disloyal to her; anything
that was against her was wrung from him reluctantly.
But had she no shrinking from what was being
done, no repugnance at it, no sense that she was soiled
and a sordid tinge given to her life? No, she had none
of these things; she wanted to be free; he could have
freed her and would not; now Sidney Hazlewood and
Babba Flint were setting her at liberty. He was far
off, they were near; he was puzzling, their conduct was
intelligible. She felt herself growing more and more
separated from him; was she not growing nearer and
nearer to them? The law ruled and the tendency
worked through such incidents as these; in them they
sprang to light and were fully revealed, their underlying
strength became momentarily open and manifest. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>[Pg 347]</span>
would go on ruling and working, using the puzzle, the
wound, the resentment, the separation, the ever-growing
distance, the impossibility of understanding. These
things blotted out memories, so that his very face
would grow blurred for her, the tones of his voice dim
and strange, the touch of his lips alien and forgotten.
She would be travelling a lot in the next few weeks
and would not have time to write many letters. He
knew, as he read, that she would write no more letters
at all, that this was the last to come from her to him,
the last that would recall the intimate and sweet companionship
whose ending it deplored with poor pathetic
bewilderment. She did not see how they came to be
so far apart and to be drifting farther and farther apart;
she saw only the fact. Was it any easier for him to
bear because he seemed to see the reason and the
necessity?</p>

<p>So, "Good-bye," she ended; and it was the end.</p>

<p>He put the letter away in the drawer whence he had
taken the bank-notes for Jack Fenning, drew a chair
up to the table and, sitting down, untied the red tape
round a brief which lay there. He began to read but
broke off when he had read a few lines and sat for a
moment or two, looking straight in front of him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "there's an end of that." And he
went on with the brief. It was indeed the most natural
thing in the world.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a><span>CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<span class="smaller">"A GOOD SIGHT"</span></h2>


<p>"One unbroken round of triumph from the hour
we landed to the hour we left," said Babba
Flint. He was off duty, had dined well, and come on
to Mrs. Pocklington's rather late; although perfectly
master of himself, he was not inclined at this moment
to think less well of the world than it deserved.</p>

<p>"Including the legal proceedings?" asked Irene Bowdon,
studying the figure on her French fan.</p>

<p>"Well, we put them through all right; pretty sharp
too." Babba looked at his companion with a droll air.
"Fact is," he continued, "some of us thought it as well
to fix the thing while we were on the other side; complications
might have arisen here, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what you mean. It's her own look-out;
I daresay Mr. Hazlewood will make a very good
husband."</p>

<p>"He won't make much difference except in business
matters," observed Babba composedly. "We all know
that well enough." Babba did not seem to deplore the
state of affairs he indicated.</p>

<p>"Does he&mdash;the man himself?" Her curiosity was
natural enough.</p>

<p>"Lord love you, yes, Lady Bowdon. It's not like
the other affair, you see. That wasn't business; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>[Pg 349]</span>
is." He eyed Irene's face, which was rather troubled.
"Best thing, after all," he added.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Irene, looking up with a faint
smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, mind you, I'm sorry in a way. But if you
won't pay the price, you don't acquire the article, that's
all. I did it for Hazlewood, I'd have done it for Mead.
But if you don't like being in large letters in the bills
and the headlines, and being cross-examined yourself,
and having her cross-examined, and having everybody&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In short, if you don't like going through the
mud&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got to stay on the near side of the ditch.
Precisely."</p>

<p>Irene sighed. Babba fixed his eye-glass and took a
view of the room.</p>

<p>"I'm not Mead's sort," he continued, his eye roving
round the while, "but I know how it struck him. Well,
it didn't strike Sidney that way and I suppose it didn't
strike her. Therefore&mdash;" He broke off, conceiving
that his meaning was clear enough. "She's coming
here to-night," he went on a moment later.</p>

<p>"And he's here."</p>

<p>"Situation!" murmured Babba, spreading his hands
out.</p>

<p>"Oh dear no," said Irene scornfully. "We don't
go in for situations in society, Mr. Flint. Isn't that
Alice Muddock over there?"</p>

<p>"It is; and Jewett with her. Still no situation?"
He smiled and twisted the glass more firmly in his eye.
As he spoke Ashley Mead came up to Alice and Bertie,
shook hands with both, talked to them for a moment
and then passed on, leaving them alone together. Alice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>[Pg 350]</span>
looked after him for an instant with a faint smile and
then turned her face towards her companion again.</p>

<p>"Your husband here?" asked Babba of Lady
Bowdon.</p>

<p>"Yes, my husband's here," answered Irene. She
nearly said, "My husband's here too," but such emphatic
strokes were not needed to define a situation to
Babba's professional eye. "He's somewhere in the
crowd," she added.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Babba, whether mirthfully or
merely cheerfully Irene could not determine. Her next
question seemed to rise to her lips inevitably:</p>

<p>"And what's become of Mr. Fenning?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows and nobody cares," said Babba.
"He doesn't count any longer, you see, Lady Bowdon.
We've marked Jack Fenning off. Bless you, I believe
Miss Pinsent's forgotten he ever existed!"</p>

<p>"She seems good at forgetting."</p>

<p>"What? Oh, yes, uncommon," agreed Babba rather
absently; a pretty girl had chanced to pass by at the
minute.</p>

<p>Irene was inclined to laugh. With all his eye for the
situation Babba reduced it to absolutely nothing but a
situation, a group, a <i>tableau</i>, a pose of figures at which
you stopped to look for a moment and passed on, saying
that it was very effective, that it carried such and
such an impression, and would hold the house for this
or that number of seconds. It was no use for life to
ask Babba to take it with the tragic seriousness which
Irene had at her disposal.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she'll have forgotten me," she said.</p>

<p>"She always remembers when she sees you again,"
Babba assured her.</p>

<p>"Ought that to be a comfort to me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>[Pg 351]</span></p>

<p>"Well, it would be good enough for me," said Babba,
and he began to hum a tune softly. "After a year, you
know, it's something," he broke off to add.</p>

<p>"Have you really been away a year?"</p>

<p>"Every hour of it, without including the time I was
seasick," said Babba with a retrospective shudder. "Ah,
here she comes!" he went on, and explained the satisfaction
which rang in his tones by saying, "I see her most
days, but she's always a good sight, you know."</p>

<p>As Irene watched Ora Pinsent pass up the room responding
gaily to a hundred greetings, it occurred to
her that Babba's was perhaps the truest point of view
from which to regard her old acquaintance, her friend
and enemy. In personal intercourse Ora might be unsatisfactory;
perhaps it was not well to let her become
too much to you; it was no doubt imprudent to rely on
becoming or remaining very much to her. But considered
as a "good sight," as an embellishment of the room
she was in, of the society that knew and the world that
held her, as an increase of beauty on the earth, as a
fountain of gaiety, both as a mirror to picture and as a
magnet to draw forth fine emotions and great passions,
she seemed to justify herself. This was not to call her
"nice" in Lady Muddock's sense; but it was really the
way to take her, the only way in which she would fit
into Irene's conception of an ordered universe. Ashley
Mead had not, it seemed, been content to take her like
that. Was the man who walked a few yards behind her,
with his tired smile and his deep wrinkle, his carefully
arranged effective hair, and his fifty years under decent
control&mdash;was her new husband content to take her like
that and to accept for himself the accidental character
which she had the knack of imparting to her domestic
relations? He was more respectable and more presentable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>[Pg 352]</span>
than Jack Fenning. Jack Fenning counted for
nothing now; in truth did Mr. Hazlewood count for
much more? Except, of course, as Babba had observed,
in business matters.</p>

<p>Irene looked up with a little start; there had been a
movement by her; she found Babba Flint gone and
Ashley Mead in his place. His eyes left Ora and
turned to her.</p>

<p>"Splendid, isn't she?" he said in a spontaneous
unintended outburst.</p>

<p>"Yes; but&mdash;" Irene's fan moved almost imperceptibly,
but its point was now towards Sidney Hazlewood.
"Would you like it?" she asked in a half-whisper.</p>

<p>Ashley made no answer; his regard was fixed on Ora
Pinsent. Ora was in conversation and did not perceive
the pair who watched her so attentively. They heard
her laugh; her face was upturned to the man she talked
to in the old way, with its old suggestion of expecting
to be kissed. Sidney Hazlewood had disappeared into
the throng; yes, he seemed decidedly accidental, as
accidental as Jack Fenning himself.</p>

<p>"There's my husband," said Irene, as Bowdon appeared
from among the crowd and went up to Ora.</p>

<p>After a moment he pointed to where they were, and
he and Ora came towards them together.</p>

<p>"Prepare to receive cavalry," said Irene with a nervous
little laugh; the next instant her hands were caught
in Ora's outstretched grasp. "What an age since I've
seen you!" Ora cried, and kissed her very affectionately.
She remembered Irene when she saw her again,
as Babba had foretold.</p>

<p>The two women talked, the two men stood by and
listened. Ora's greeting to Ashley had been friendly
but quite ordinary; she did not say that it was an age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>[Pg 353]</span>
since she had seen him, but met him as though they
had parted yesterday. The situation seemed to fade
away; the sense that after all nothing had happened
recurred to Irene's mind. Sidney Hazlewood instead
of Jack Fenning&mdash;that was all! But a passing glance
at Ashley's face changed her mood; the smile with
which he regarded Ora was not the smile he used to
have for her. He was admiring still (how should he
not?), but now he was analysing also; he was looking at
her from the outside; he was no longer absorbed in her.</p>

<p>"Oh, my trip all seems like a dream," said Ora. "A
lovely dream! You must come and see the piece when
we play it here."</p>

<p>They all declared that they would come and see the
play; it and it alone seemed to represent her trip to
Ora's mind; the legal proceedings and Mr. Hazlewood
were not thought of.</p>

<p>"I had lots of fun and no trouble," said Ora.</p>

<p>Ashley Mead gave a sudden short laugh. It made
Irene start and she fell to fingering her fan in some
embarrassment; Bowdon's smile also was uncomfortable.
Ora looked at Ashley with an air of surprise.</p>

<p>"He's laughing at me for something," she said to
Irene. "I don't know what. Will you tell me if I come
down to supper with you, Ashley?"</p>

<p>She still called him Ashley; Irene was definitely displeased;
she thought the use of his first name decidedly
unseemly under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"I'll try," said Ashley. Ora took his arm and waved
a gay adieu. "Come and see me very soon," she called,
and, as she turned away, she shot a glance at Bowdon.
"You come too; you haven't been for&mdash;" She paused
and ended with a laugh. "Well, for almost longer than
I can remember."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>[Pg 354]</span></p>

<p>The supper-room was not very full; they got a little
table to themselves and sat down. It was away in a
corner: they were in effect alone.</p>

<p>"What were you laughing at? Me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," answered Ashley.</p>

<p>She looked at him with a rather distrustful and
inquisitive glance.</p>

<p>"How funnily everything has turned out," she began
rather timidly. It was just as he had expected her to
begin.</p>

<p>"Funnily? Oh, I don't see that. I call it all very
natural," he said.</p>

<p>"Natural!" Ora repeated, lifting her brows. Ashley
nodded, and drank some champagne.</p>

<p>Ora seemed disappointed to find him taking that
view. The expression of her face set him smiling
again.</p>

<p>"I don't think I like you to laugh," she said. "It
seems rather unkind, I think."</p>

<p>He raised his eyes to hers suddenly. "Then I won't
laugh," he said, in a lower tone. "But I wasn't laughing
in that way at all, really." He had, at all events,
grown grave now; he pushed his chair a little back and
leant his elbow on the table, resting his head on his
hand.</p>

<p>"If I told you all about how it happened&mdash;" she
began.</p>

<p>"Your letter told me," he interrupted. "I don't
want you to tell me again."</p>

<p>Her eyes grew affectionate. She laid a hand on his
arm.</p>

<p>"Was it hard, dear Ashley?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"I knew how it would be from the moment you went
away," was his answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a>[Pg 355]</span></p>

<p>"Then why did you let me go?" she asked quickly,
and, as he fancied, rather reproachfully. She seemed
to snatch at a chance of excusing herself.</p>

<p>"You wanted to go."</p>

<p>Ora looked a little troubled; she knit her brows and
clasped her hands; she seemed to be turning what he
said over in her mind. She did not deny its truth, but its
truth distressed her vaguely.</p>

<p>"It's no use bothering ourselves trying to explain
things," Ashley went on more lightly. "It's all over
now, anyhow." He was conscious of the old weakness&mdash;he
could not cause her pain. His impulse even now was
to make her think that she had been in all things right.</p>

<p>"Yes." Her dark eyes rested on his face a moment.
"You liked it while it lasted?"</p>

<p>"Very much," he admitted, smiling again for a
moment. "But it's over. I'm sorry it's over, you
know."</p>

<p>"Are you, Ashley? Really sorry?" He nodded.
"So am I," she said with a sigh.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and she followed his example; but
she would not let him take her back to where the people
were, but made him sit down in a recess in the passage
outside the drawing-room. She seemed to have fallen
into a pensive mood; he was content to sit by her in
silence until she spoke again.</p>

<p>"Sidney was very kind, and very helpful to me," she
said at last. "I got to like him very much." She was
pleading with Ashley in her praise of Hazlewood.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know," he murmured. "Good heavens,
you don't think I'm blaming you?"</p>

<p>He had said that to her before; she did not accept it
so readily now.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are," she said, with a little temper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>[Pg 356]</span>
"You've set me down for something&mdash;as some sort of
person. I know you have. You may say that's not
blaming, but it's just as bad."</p>

<p>He was surprised at her penetration.</p>

<p>"I suppose you always felt like that really, down in
your heart," she added thoughtfully. "But you used
to like me."</p>

<p>"I should rather think I did," said Ashley.</p>

<p>"You don't now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Not so much? Not in the same way?" A touch
of urgency had come into her tone.</p>

<p>"Should you expect that? And I'm sure you
wouldn't wish it."</p>

<p>"Some people go on caring always&mdash;whatever
happens."</p>

<p>He leant forward towards her and spoke in a low
serious voice.</p>

<p>"I shall never be able to think of my life without
thinking of you," he told her. After a pause he added,
"That's the truth of it, but I don't know exactly how
much it comes to. A good deal, I expect; more than
generally happens in such cases."</p>

<p>"You'll marry somebody!" The prospect did not
seem to please her.</p>

<p>"Very likely," he answered. "What difference does
that make? Whatever happens, you're there. You
put yourself there, and you can't take yourself away
again."</p>

<p>"I don't want to," said Ora, with all her old sincerity
in the avowal of her feelings.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't," he said, with a faint smile.
She had spoken seriously, almost pathetically, as though
she were asking to be allowed to stay with him in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>[Pg 357]</span>
such way as he had hinted at; for the first time he
recognised the look of appeal once so familiar. It
brought to him mingled pain and pleasure; it roused a
tenderness which made him anxious above all to say
nothing that would hurt her, and to leave her happy
and content with herself when they parted; this also
was quite in the old fashion.</p>

<p>"Why, you'll stand for the best time and the best
thing in my life," he said. "You'll be my holiday,
Ora. But we can't have holidays all the time."</p>

<p>"We had some lovely days together, hadn't we? I'm
not sure the first wasn't best of all. You remember?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember."</p>

<p>"You're laughing again." But now Ora laughed a
little herself. The cloud was passing away; she was
regaining the serenity of which too much self-examination
had threatened to rob her, and the view of herself
as the passive subject of occurrences at which she, in
common with the rest of the world, was at liberty to sigh
or smile in a detached irresponsibility.</p>

<p>A man passed by and bowed, saying, "How do you
do, Mrs. Hazlewood?"</p>

<p>"Isn't that funny?" asked Ora. "Nobody thinks of
calling me Mrs. Hazlewood."</p>

<p>"I certainly shan't think of calling you anything of
the kind," said Ashley.</p>

<p>She laughed, seemed to hesitate a little, but then
risked her shot.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have expected me to be called Mrs.
Mead, would you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't," he answered with a smile. The
whole case seemed to be stated in her question. She
not only would not have been called, but she would not
really have been, Mrs. Mead&mdash;not in any sense which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>[Pg 358]</span>
was of true importance. Neither had she been Mrs.
Fenning; neither was she Mrs. Hazlewood; she was
and would remain Ora Pinsent.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't mind it," Ora went on, with a smile
whose graciousness was for both her actual husband in
the drawing-room and her hypothetical husband in the
recess. "But somehow it always sounds odd." She
laughed, adding, "I suppose some people would call
that odd&mdash;your friend Alice Muddock, for instance."</p>

<p>"I haven't the least doubt that Alice Muddock would
call it very odd."</p>

<p>"She never liked me really, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps she didn't."</p>

<p>"But she did like you, Ashley."</p>

<p>"She certainly doesn't," he said, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'd never have got on with her," said Ora
scornfully. Then she jumped up suddenly, crying,
"There's Babba, I want to speak to him." But before
she went, she said one word more. "You were the
truest finest friend, Ashley. And I wasn't worthy."
She looked at him in appeal. "No, not worthy," she
repeated. "I think Alice Muddock's right about me."
She threw out her hands in the saddest little protest,
dumbly accusing the Power that had made her what she
was. "I think you could still break my heart by being
unhappy," said Ashley Mead. She gave him a little
wistful smile, shook her head, and walked quickly away.
Her voice rose gaily the next moment, crying, "Babba,
Babba!" And that was all Babba's situation came to.</p>

<p>There was in fact no situation; there was only a state
of things; so Ashley decided as he sat on alone. Perhaps
rather a strange state of things, but certainly no
more than that. Her being here in town, liable to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>[Pg 359]</span>
met, having to be spoken to, being again a presence as
well as a memory&mdash;all this made his position different
from what it had been while she was over seas. But
stranger still was the knowledge that, however often she
were met and spoken to, the presence would be and
would rest different from the memory. He had recognised
the possibility that all which had come to him in
the months of separation would vanish again at her
living touch and that the old feelings would revive in
their imperious exclusive sway. He had known that
this might happen; he had not known whether he
hoped or feared its happening; because, if it happened,
there was no telling what else might happen. Now he
became aware that it would not happen, and (perhaps
this was strangest of all) that the insuperable obstacle
came from himself and not from her. She had not
ceased, and could not cease, to attract, amuse, and
charm, or even to be the woman with whom out of all
women he would best like to be. But here the power
of her presence stopped; it owned limits; it had not a
boundless empire; that belonged now only to the memory
of her. It was then the memory, not the presence,
which he would always think of when he thought of his
life, which would be the great thing to him, which would
abide always with him, unchanged, unweakened, unspoilt
either by what she was now or in the future might be.
She was beyond her own power; herself, as she had
been to him, she could neither efface nor mar. He had
idealised her; he was rich in the possession of the image
his idealising had made; but the woman before his eyes
was different or seen with different eyes. As this came
home to his mind, a sense of relief rose for a moment
in him; he hailed its appearance with eagerness; but
its appearance was brief; it was drowned in a sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a>[Pg 360]</span>
loss. He was free; that was the undoubted meaning
of what he felt; but he was free at a great cost. It
was as though a man got rid of his fetters by cutting off
the limb that carried them.</p>

<p>He strolled back into the drawing-room. The throng
had grown thin. Alice Muddock and Bertie Jewett
were gone; Alice had kept out of Ora's way. Babba
Flint was just saying good-bye; the Bowdons, Ora, and
Hazlewood were standing in a group together in the
middle of the room. He noticed that Hazlewood shifted
his position a little so as to present a fullback view.
Really Hazlewood need not feel uncomfortable. Hazlewood
as an individual was of such very small importance.
However Ashley did not thrust his presence on
him, but went off and talked for a few moments with
his hostess. Meanwhile the group separated; Ora
came towards Mrs. Pocklington, Hazlewood following.
Ashley hastily said his own farewell and sauntered off;
Ora waved her hand to him with her lavish freedom
and airy grace of gesture, calling, "Good-night, Ashley!"
Hazlewood exchanged a nod with him; then the
pair passed out.</p>

<p>In the hall Bowdon suggested that they should walk a
little way together, the night being fine. Irene knew
well why they wanted to walk together, but got into her
carriage without objection; she had no more to fear
from Ora. As for Ashley, so for her Ora's work lay
in the past, not in the present or the future. The
difference in her life, as in his, had been made once and
for all; nothing that came now could either increase it
or take it away. Her fears, her jealousy, her grudge,
were for the memory, not for the presence.</p>

<p>The two men who had wanted to talk to one another
walked in silence, side by side. But presently the
silence seemed absurd, and they spoke of trivial matters.
Then came silence again.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a>[Pg 361]</span>
"I mustn't come much further," said Bowdon at last,
"or I shan't get home to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on a little way; it'll do you good," said
Ashley.</p>

<p>So they went on a little way. And at last Bowdon
spoke.</p>

<p>"She doesn't look a day older," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. She won't look a day older for ever so
long."</p>

<p>"And old Hazlewood's just the same, wrinkle and
all."</p>

<p>"She won't smooth that away," said Ashley with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Bowdon took his arm and they walked on together for
a little way further. Then Bowdon stopped.</p>

<p>"I'm going home," he said, dropping Ashley's arm.
"Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night," Ashley answered.</p>

<p>But for a moment Bowdon did not go. With a smile
at once confidential and apologetic he put the question
which was in his mind: "It's infernally impertinent of
me, but, I say, Ashley, are you still in love with her?"</p>

<p>Ashley looked him full in the face for a moment, and
then gave his answer. "No, I'm not, but I wish to
God I was!" he said.</p>

<p>For in that love his life had done its uttermost; it
would do no such good thing again. He had called
Ora's time his holiday time. It was over. The rare
quality of its pleasure he would taste no more. Bowdon
nodded in understanding. "A wonderful creature!"
he said, as he turned away.</p>

<p>A wonderful creature! Or, as Babba Flint had preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>[Pg 362]</span>
to put it, "A good sight." Yes, that must be
the way to look at her, the right way to look at her
existence, the truth about it. Only when Ashley remembered
that little gesture of dumb protest, the truth
seemed rather hard&mdash;and hard not for himself alone.
If she sacrificed others, if her nature were shaped to
that, was she not a sacrifice herself&mdash;sacrificed that
beautiful things might be set before the eyes and in the
hearts of men? Let judgment then be gentle, and love
unashamed.</p>
